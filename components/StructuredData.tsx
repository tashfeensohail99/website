/**
 * Schema.org JSON-LD for the organisation and its offices.
 *
 * Three deliberate choices, each of which is a trap other sites fall into:
 *
 * 1. `ProfessionalService`, NOT `LegalService`/`Attorney`. The firm does employ
 *    lawyers, but the entity providing the service is a consultancy. Claiming to
 *    BE a legal practice in machine-readable markup, on a public site, is a
 *    claim a regulator can read as easily as Google can. Revisit only once the
 *    lawyer roster and its credentials are confirmed — and even then, only if
 *    a licensee genuinely is the provider.
 *
 * 2. No `Review` or `AggregateRating`. Self-applied ratings are ignored by
 *    Google and are manual-action bait on a YMYL site. Ratings must come from a
 *    platform that owns them, not from us about ourselves.
 *
 * 3. Each office is its own LocalBusiness with a distinct @id. Sharing one @id
 *    across locations merges them in Google's eyes and wastes the strongest
 *    asset the firm has — a real Canadian office alongside Pakistani ones.
 *
 * Offices without a confirmed address are omitted entirely rather than emitted
 * half-empty: incomplete NAP is worse than absent NAP, because it splits the
 * local signal instead of simply not making one.
 */
/**
 * Opening hours as STRUCTURED data, not just the prose rendered on /about.
 * This is what produces "Open now · Closes 6 pm" in a Google result and in
 * Maps; a human-readable string alone produces nothing.
 *
 * Parsed from the office's own `hours` string so the two can never drift apart,
 * but deliberately NARROW: it only understands the "Monday to Saturday,
 * 9 am – 6 pm" shape both offices currently use. Anything else returns nothing
 * rather than guessing, because wrong hours in Maps send a real person to a
 * closed door — strictly worse than no hours at all.
