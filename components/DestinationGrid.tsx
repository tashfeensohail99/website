/**
 * The destinations mosaic.
 *
 * An asymmetric bento grid: Canada takes a double-height cell because it is what
 * the firm actually files most, and the rest sit alongside it. The point is that
 * a reader grasps "several countries, Canada first" in one glance rather than
 * reading five identical cards.
 *
 * ON THE ARTWORK: real flags, drawn to their construction sheets — see Flags.tsx
 * for the geometry that matters (the Union Flag's counterchanged saltire, the
 * 6-5-6 star lattice, the eleven-point leaf). This grid previously used abstract
 * emblems on the reasoning that an almost-right flag reads as careless. That
 * reasoning was sound and the conclusion was wrong: the answer is to draw them
 * correctly. It also removes a real bug — Europe and Investor routes were both
 * rendering the SAME globe, so two of five cards had identical artwork.
 *
 * Each flag is presented as an object on the tile — inset, ringed, gently
 * rotated, with a shadow — rather than a full-bleed background. A flag flooding
 * the card would fight the gradient and, at the opacity needed for the title to
 * stay legible, would turn the Union Flag and the Stars and Stripes into grey
 * mush. Kept as a distinct object they read at full colour and stay correct.
 *
 * "Investor routes" is not a country and gets no flag — it keeps the globe.
