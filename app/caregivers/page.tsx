 * Caregiver immigration routes.

 * Two things this page has to do. First, describe the route structurally, because

 * replaced under new names. Naming one as though it were permanent is the single
 * easiest way to mislead a reader here.
 *
 * Second, and more urgently: caregiver placement is one of the most heavily
 * defrauded areas in Pakistani migration. Sold job offers, invented families,
 * "registration fees" for intakes that are not open. That warning is the reason

  {
    q: 'Someone is offering me a caregiver job in Canada for a fee. Should I pay?',
    a: 'No. A person who genuinely needs care in their home does not sell the job to the worker. Canadian provinces regulate recruitment and generally prohibit a recruiter from charging a worker to find them employment — the detail varies by province, and the province you would work in publishes its own rules. Separately, where the offer involves a labour market impact assessment, Employment and Social Development Canada prohibits the employer or their representative from recovering that cost from the worker. Caregiver placement is among the most heavily defrauded areas we see from Pakistan. Treat a price attached to a job offer as the reason to stop.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I check whether the job offer is real?',
    a: 'Speak directly to the household or organisation you would work for, by video, without the agent present or interpreting. Ask who you would be caring for, where, and on what hours and wage. A genuine employer answers those questions easily. An arrangement where all contact runs through a middleman, or where the employer is unreachable until you have paid, is not one to proceed on.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I apply as a caregiver without any job offer?',
    a: 'Generally no. Caregiver routes are built around care that someone in Canada actually needs. Where no caregiver intake is open, the alternatives are the ordinary work permit and permanent residence routes, which assess you on different criteria entirely.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does looking after my own parents or children count as experience?',
    a: 'Normally not. These routes look for paid work as a caregiver, provable through an employer. Unpaid family care is real work but it is usually not what the requirement means, and presenting it as employment creates a misrepresentation problem.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do these routes lead to permanent residence?',
    a: 'That has been the design intent of recent caregiver programmes, and the more recent ones were built to grant permanent residence at or near arrival rather than after years of work in Canada. But the structure differs from programme to programme, and older versions required qualifying work in Canada first. Which structure applies to you depends entirely on which route is in force when you apply.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can my family come with me?',
    a: 'Caregiver routes have commonly allowed a spouse or partner and dependent children to be included, in a way that many work permit routes do not. The specific entitlement varies by programme and is set out in the instructions for the route that is open. Confirm it before you plan around it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the current caps, fees and language scores?',
    a: 'IRCC publishes those, and they change with each version of the programme. We do not print them here, because a caregiver applicant relying on a figure from an expired pilot is exactly how people file the wrong thing. Read them at the source on the day you apply.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee me a caregiver visa?',
    a: 'No. No one can. Whether an intake is even open is not within anyone’s control, and the decision is a visa officer’s. What we can do is tell you before you spend money whether your experience, language and education realistically fit this route.',

              This is, in our experience, the most heavily defrauded area of Pakistani migration to
              Canada. The recurring patterns are an invented family, a real family who never agreed to
              anything, a “registration fee” for an intake that is not open, and an offer letter that
              exists only as a PDF. Money paid for these is not recovered. Worse, a file built on
              documents you did not write is misrepresentation, and that carries a bar on applying
              again — which lands on you, not on the agent.

              The distinction that trips people up is the setting. These are routes for care delivered
              in someone’s home. Working as an attendant in a hospital, a long-term care facility or a
              licensed daycare centre is care work, but it is generally assessed under different
              occupations and different immigration routes. If that describes your experience, say so

            <Prose>
              <p>
                Caregiver immigration in Canada has been delivered through a long succession of
                time-limited pilot programmes. Each has its own name, its own eligibility settings, its
                own application window and usually its own cap on how many applications are accepted.
                When a pilot ends it is sometimes replaced, sometimes after a gap, and sometimes on
                materially different terms.
              </p>
              <p>
                So a page that tells you “apply to programme X” is worth very little six months later,
                and a great deal of harm in this space is done by advice that is simply out of date.
                What we can tell you reliably is the shape of the thing: home-based care work, a genuine
                employer, tested language, assessed education, provable experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether an intake is open on the day you read this is a question for IRCC’s own pages,
                and it is the first thing we check before anyone starts spending.

            <Prose>
              <p>
                Older caregiver programmes worked on a two-stage model: you came on a work permit,
                completed a qualifying period of caregiving work in Canada, and only then applied for
                permanent residence. The weakness of that model was well documented — a worker whose
                status depended on completing hours for a particular employer was in a poor position to
                complain about how they were treated.
              </p>
              <p>
                More recent programme design has moved away from that, toward granting permanent
                residence at or close to arrival, so that the worker is not dependent on finishing a
                period of work to secure status. Whether that holds in the next redesign is not
                something anyone can tell you in advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is a direction, not a promise. Which model applies to you is set by the route that is
                actually open when you apply, and you should read that route’s own instructions rather
                than assume.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>Paying for the job.</strong> The dominant pattern, and the most expensive. The fee
            is charged, the employer is unreachable, and there was never a household expecting you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Experience letters that prove nothing.</strong> A letter saying someone “worked as
            a caregiver” with no duties, no hours, no wage and no contactable employer does not
            establish experience. Care work in Pakistan is frequently informal and cash-paid, which
            makes this genuinely hard — but it is better to face that early than to submit a file that
            cannot survive verification.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Facility experience presented as home care.</strong> Hospital, clinic or daycare
            work is not home-based care. Restating it as though it were is a misrepresentation risk,
            and it is easily checked.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Starting when the window opens.</strong> Language tests and credential assessments
            sit with third parties and are not quick. Where an intake is capped, it can close well
            before a file started at announcement is ready.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming last year’s rules.</strong> Applicants regularly prepare against a pilot
            that has already been replaced, then file against criteria that no longer exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ignoring how you will be treated.</strong> Live-in arrangements with a single
            private employer can leave a worker isolated. Written terms, agreed hours, a clear wage and
            somewhere to raise a problem are not luxuries in this route — they are the difference
            between a good outcome and a bad one.

            Whether an intake is open, what it is called, what the language and education thresholds
            are, how many applications will be accepted and what it costs — all of that is set by IRCC
            and changes with each version of the programme. We deliberately do not reproduce those
            figures, because in this particular area an out-of-date number is what causes people to file
            the wrong thing or pay the wrong person.
