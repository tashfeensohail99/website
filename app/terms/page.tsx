/**
 * ⚠️ LAWYER REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE LAUNCH.
 *
 * These are terms for USING THE WEBSITE — what the pages are and are not. They
 * are deliberately NOT terms of engagement: what the firm owes a paying client,
 * fees, refunds, liability and termination belong in the signed agreement, drafted
 * by the firm's own lawyers. Do not let this page grow into that.
 *
 * The one clause that carries real weight here is the "this is not advice"
 * boundary. On a site whose whole strategy is publishing genuinely useful legal
 * information, the line between "useful information" and "advice you relied on"
 * is exactly where a complaint would land. Counsel must set that wording.

          Everything published here is general information about how immigration systems work. It is

        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          Immigration rules change constantly — sometimes in a single announcement, sometimes
          retroactively. We date our pages and we correct them when we learn something has changed.
          But <strong className="text-ink-900">a page you read today may have been overtaken by an
          announcement this morning</strong>, and no website can be a substitute for someone looking

          Where we state a rule, we try to point you at the government source that says so. If the
          two ever disagree, the government is right and we are wrong — tell us, and we will fix the
          page.

          Nor does messaging us a question. We act for you only once we have both agreed the work in
          writing and you have engaged us. Until then, please do not send us anything confidential or
          time-critical and assume it is being acted on.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-12 font-serif text-3xl text-balance">What we don’t promise</h2>
