 * The volume leader — 55 signed agreements, ~PKR 167k each, 42% close.

 * It is the entry rung, not the headline: most people meet the firm here. The
 * strategically important part of the page is the refusal bridge at the bottom,
 * which walks a refused visitor across to the JR practice (50% close, ~PKR 459k).
 *
 * The only approval figure stated is Canada's GLOBAL rate, which IRCC publishes.
 * Every Pakistan-specific number in circulation (35–50%) is unsourced — IRCC does
 * not publish per-country visitor rates — so none appears here. See lib/facts.ts.

            The most common Canadian visa — and the most commonly refused. Most of the refusals we

        <h2 className="font-serif text-3xl text-balance">What this visa actually is</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          A temporary resident visa lets you visit Canada — family, tourism, business meetings, a
          conference. It is not a work permit and it is not a route to staying. Applying for it as
          though it were is one of the reliable ways to be refused.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          Worldwide, Canada approved about <strong className="text-ink-900">49%</strong> of visitor
          visa applications as of late 2025. That is everyone, globally — not a Pakistan figure.
          Anyone quoting you a precise Pakistan approval rate is repeating something they cannot
          source, because IRCC does not publish it.
        </p>

        <h2 className="mt-12 font-serif text-3xl text-balance">What the officer is really asking</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          One question sits underneath the whole application:{' '}
          <strong className="text-ink-900">will this person go home?</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          Everything else — your job, your property, your family, your bank statements, your travel
          history — is evidence for or against that one question. Most people assemble documents.
          The ones who get approved build an argument.

          Many of the people we work with apply from Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman or Qatar. It changes
          the file: your residency status, your employer letter, your salary transfers and your
          police certificate all come from where you live, not from Pakistan — while parts of your
          history are still Pakistani.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          You stay where you are. We handle the Pakistan side.

          <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
            Then start somewhere else. The letter you received doesn’t tell you the real reason — the
            officer’s actual notes are in a separate file you are entitled to request. Reapplying
            without reading them is guessing, and a second refusal makes the third attempt harder.
