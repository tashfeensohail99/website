    a: (
      <>
        No. A visa officer decides your application, and no consultant in Pakistan can overrule that —
        anyone who promises you a visa is not being honest. What we can do is tell you whether your
        case is strong, fix what is weak before it is filed, and say so plainly if we don’t think you
        should apply yet.
      </>
    ),

    q: 'What approval rate does Canada have for visit visas?',
    a: (
      <>
        <strong className="text-ink-900">IRCC does not publish a Pakistan-specific approval rate</strong>{' '}
        — so anyone quoting you a precise “rate for Pakistanis” is repeating a number they cannot
        source. Global rates also move from year to year and say nothing about your file. What
        actually decides it is the strength of your specific application, not a statistic.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'The bank balance is really the whole thing?',
    a: (
      <>
        It’s the most common single reason we see files fall down, but it is never the whole thing. The
        officer weighs your funds, your ties, your travel history and whether the trip makes sense —
        together. A strong balance with a weak reason to return home does not save an application.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I apply from the Gulf instead of Pakistan?',
    a: (
      <>
        Yes, and many of the people we work with do. If you live in Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Oman or
        Qatar, your residency, employer letter, salary transfers and police certificate come from where
        you live — while parts of your history stay Pakistani. You stay where you are; we handle the
        Pakistan side.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'My visa was already refused — should I just reapply?',
    a: (
      <>
        Not blindly. The refusal letter doesn’t tell you the real reason — the officer’s actual notes
        are in a separate file you are entitled to request. Reapplying without reading them is guessing,
        and a second refusal makes the third attempt harder.{' '}
