  },
  {
    q: 'Can I buy a job offer from a designated employer?',
    a: 'No. Paying for a job offer is fraud, whether the employer is real or invented. If it is invented, you lose the money. If it is real, you have induced a designated employer to breach the commitments their designation rests on, which puts their designation and your application at risk. Misrepresentation on an immigration application carries a bar on applying again. There is no version of this that ends well.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I apply on my own, without an employer, and find work later?',
    a: 'No. There is no candidate-first entry to this programme. The sequence begins with a designated employer and a job offer, and every subsequent step depends on it. If you have no Atlantic employer, this is not your route today — a different one may be.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I have to stay in the Atlantic province?',
    a: 'The programme is built around settling in the province that endorsed you, and your application asks you to confirm that intention. Permanent residence itself carries mobility rights under the Charter, but applying with no intention of living there is misrepresentation. Do not treat the Atlantic provinces as a doorway to Toronto.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is a settlement plan, and who pays for it?',
    a: 'It is a document prepared with an approved immigrant settlement service provider that identifies what you and your family will need on arrival — language, schooling, credential recognition, community connections — and which services exist locally. Settlement service organisations are funded to provide it. Be sceptical of anyone charging you separately for one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the language and education requirements?',
    a: 'Both are set by the programme and vary by the skill category of the job offer, and both are revised from time to time. IRCC publishes the current thresholds and the list of accepted tests and credential-assessment bodies. We will not print numbers here that you might rely on a year from now.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does it take and what does it cost?',

  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee an endorsement or permanent residence?',

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            The Atlantic Immigration Program is a permanent federal programme, run in partnership with
            the four Atlantic provinces, that leads directly to permanent residence rather than to a
            temporary permit. It exists because employers in Atlantic Canada have persistent difficulty
            filling roles locally, and because the region wants newcomers who stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            It works differently from most employer-led routes. Instead of testing each vacancy through
            a Labour Market Impact Assessment, the programme approves the employer once, in advance.
            A business applies to its province to become a{' '}
            <strong>designated employer</strong>. Designation says the province has looked at that
            business — its standing with labour and occupational health and safety authorities, its
            record, and its willingness to support newcomers — and is prepared to let it hire through
            the programme.
          </p>
          <p>
            After that, each hire is assessed as a pair: the job and the person. The province issues an{' '}
            <strong>endorsement</strong>, and the endorsement is what allows a federal permanent
            residence application to be filed. Alongside it sits a <strong>settlement plan</strong>,
            prepared with an approved settlement organisation, covering you and any family coming with
            you.
          </p>
          <p>
            The programme is one of several routes that do not run through Express Entry. If you are
            weighing it against others, our{' '}

              This is the single most exploited sentence in the programme. Because no Labour Market
              Impact Assessment is required, agents describe the route as open, or as something you can
              enter with an application and sort out the job later. You cannot. The programme replaced
              the labour market test with employer designation — it did not replace the employer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every step after the job offer depends on the offer existing. If you have no designated
              Atlantic employer, you have no file. If someone offers to supply one for a fee, that is
              the point at which to stop, not to negotiate. See how the equivalent misconception plays

              subtitle="Each province runs its own designation and endorsement process, with its own forms, contacts and priorities. The federal requirements are shared; the provincial administration is not."
            />
            <Prose>
              <p>
                The programme covers Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Newfoundland
                and Labrador. Your employer’s province determines which office designates it, which
                office endorses you, and which settlement organisations you are referred to.
              </p>
              <p>
                That provincial administration is not static, and this matters more than most pages
                admit. Provinces periodically pause new employer designations, close the programme to
                particular occupations or sectors, restrict endorsement of candidates who are outside
                Canada, or change how endorsement applications are selected. A route that was open to
                your occupation last year may not be open to it now. Before you act on anything here,
                check the current notices published by the province your employer is in — the links
                below go to those offices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each of those provinces also runs a separate provincial nominee stream, which is a
                different route with different rules — worth understanding if the Atlantic Immigration
                Program does not fit but the region still appeals to you:

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>Paying for a job offer.</strong> The most common and the most damaging. Sometimes
            the employer does not exist. Sometimes it exists but is not designated. Sometimes it is
            designated and the arrangement destroys its designation along with your application.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>An employer that is not designated.</strong> A genuine Atlantic employer with a
            genuine vacancy is still not enough on its own. Designation is a separate approval the
            business must already hold. Confirm it with the provincial office before you build plans
            around an offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Experience that does not match the offer.</strong> Endorsement assesses the pairing.
            A general work history that does not clearly evidence the specific occupation on the offer
            is a routine reason a file stalls, and experience letters written by someone else are worse
            than useless.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating the settlement plan as paperwork.</strong> An endorsement application
            without a completed settlement plan is not processed. It is prepared with an approved
            settlement organisation, and the employer has a commitment to help you access those
            services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Intending to leave immediately.</strong> The programme is about staying. Applying
            for an Atlantic endorsement while planning to relocate on landing is a misrepresentation
            risk, and it is one people talk themselves into casually.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Confusing the temporary permit with the outcome.</strong> The optional work permit
            lets you start earlier. It does not decide your permanent residence, and it comes with
            conditions. If the permanent application is refused, the permit does not save it.

            <p>
              There is no candidate-first entry here. Without a job offer from an employer that already
              holds designation in one of the four provinces, there is no step you can take to begin,
              and no fee that creates one. That is the honest answer, and it is the one most often
              withheld from people who have already paid.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also tends not to suit people whose occupation sits outside the skill categories the
              programme recognises — and provinces additionally close the route to particular
              occupations and sectors from time to time, so an occupation that qualifies federally may
              still not be endorsed where your employer is. It does not suit people whose documented
              experience does not match the job title on
              the offer, and people who intend to settle elsewhere in Canada — the programme is designed
              around remaining in the Atlantic region, and applying otherwise carries real risk.
