/**
 * The USA page leads with the correction, not the pitch.
 *
 * Two things are true at once in 2026 and almost nobody separates them: Pakistan
 * is NOT on the travel ban, but Pakistani immigrant visas ARE paused. A worried
 * applicant googling this gets the wrong answer today. Being the page that sorts
 * it out is worth more than any brochure — it is useful, it is checkable, and it
 * is the kind of thing only a firm with lawyers bothers to write.
 *
 * ⚠️ LAWYER REVIEW REQUIRED. See lib/facts.ts: the E-2 treaty position and the
 * immigrant-visa pause both carry needsLawyer:true. travel.state.gov blocks
 * automated fetching, so the DOS treaty table was never read directly and at
 * least one law-firm table omits Pakistan. The firm has already sold 2 E-2
 * engagements — a human must open the DOS table before this page ships.

          substantial amount in a real, operating US business.

          Honestly: mostly stuck from Pakistan while the immigrant visa pause holds, because they
          finish at the consulate. We would rather tell you that now than take a fee to start
          something that cannot currently finish.

      <p>
        No. Pakistan is not in the June 2025 proclamation, not in the December 2025 expansion, and
        not on the USCIS adjudication pause. Visitor, student and business visas all remain
        available to Pakistani nationals.

    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'My priority date is current — so why isn’t my visa being issued?',
    a: (
      <p>
        Because those are two different things. Since January 2026, Pakistan is one of 75 countries
        under an indefinite US immigrant visa pause. Your priority date can be current while the
        visa still isn’t being issued at the consulate in Islamabad. This is the single most
        confusing thing in the market right now.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Can Pakistani nationals apply for the E-2 investor visa?',
    a: (
      <p>
        Yes. Pakistan holds the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce with the United States, in force
        since 1961, which is what the E-2 requires. Some agents and even some law-firm tables leave
        Pakistan off by mistake. Because the treaty position matters so much here, this is a case to
        have confirmed by a lawyer against the official Department of State list before you commit.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'How much do I have to invest for an E-2?',
    a: (
      <p>
        There is no official minimum. Anyone quoting you a fixed figure is guessing. What matters is
        whether the investment is substantial relative to the business, and whether the business can
        support more than just you and your family.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'I’m already in the US lawfully — does the pause affect me?',
    a: (
      <p>
        It is reported that people already lawfully inside the United States, adjusting status
        there, are not affected in the same way as those applying at the consulate. If that is your
        situation, it is worth a proper conversation rather than a web page.
      </p>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee me a US visa?',
    a: (
      <p>
        No — and neither can anyone else. Your visa is decided by a US officer. What we can do is
        tell you honestly whether a route is even open to you right now, and say so before you’ve
        paid us anything if it isn’t.
