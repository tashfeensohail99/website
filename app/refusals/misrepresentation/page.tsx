/**
 * Misrepresentation findings under IRPA s.40.
 *
 * This is the highest-stakes page on the site, and it is deliberately the least
 * prescriptive. A finding of misrepresentation carries a statutory bar, and the
 * response to a procedural fairness letter is squarely licensed-representative
 * work. The page therefore explains WHAT the provision is and WHY an agent's
 * conduct binds the applicant — and then stops, and routes the reader to a
 * licensed representative. It does not tell anyone how to answer a letter, and
 * it does not print the length of the bar as though it were settled on their
 * particular facts.

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'What is misrepresentation under Canadian immigration law?',
    a: 'Section 40 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act makes a person inadmissible for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter, where doing so induces or could induce an error in the administration of the Act. The provision is short, and it is broad. The wording is published in full on the Justice Canada site and is the only text worth relying on.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I did not lie — my agent did. Does that protect me?',
    a: 'Not automatically. The provision reaches misrepresentation made directly or indirectly, and the application was submitted in your name with your declaration attached. This is the single most important reason not to use an unlicensed agent: their conduct can attach to you, and they carry none of the consequence. If this has happened, it is a matter for a licensed representative, not for a self-drafted explanation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'It was an honest mistake. Is that a defence?',
    a: 'Innocence is not an automatic answer. The provision is not written around intent, and applicants have been found inadmissible without any finding of deliberate deception. Canadian courts have recognised a narrow exception in genuinely exceptional circumstances, but it is narrow, it is fact-specific, and whether it could apply to your situation is a legal assessment — not something to conclude from a web page.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is a procedural fairness letter?',
    a: 'Where an officer has a concern that could lead to a refusal or a finding against you, they may write to you setting out the concern and inviting a response before deciding. It is a real and meaningful opportunity, and it is time-limited. We deliberately do not publish guidance on how to answer one, because the content of that response can materially affect the outcome and depends entirely on your own facts. Take it to a licensed representative immediately, and work to the deadline stated in the letter itself rather than any period you have read elsewhere.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does inadmissibility last?',
    a: 'The Act sets a period of inadmissibility, and for a foreign national it also restricts applying for permanent resident status during that period. Note that the clock does not simply run from the decision: section 40 sets out different starting points depending on whether the person is inside or outside Canada, and getting that wrong is how people miscount by years. We do not print the length or the start date here, because the period that applies, when it begins, and what it bars in your particular case are exactly the questions people get wrong from summaries. Read section 40 at the source, and have a licensed representative apply it to your facts.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can a misrepresentation finding be challenged?',
    a: 'There are avenues in the Canadian system for challenging decisions, and they have their own tests, deadlines and forums. Which — if any — is open to you depends on the decision made, where it was made, and what stage you are at. That assessment is licensed work. See our pages on reconsideration and judicial review for the general shape of those routes.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I just apply again and not mention it?',
    a: 'No. Prior applications and prior findings are held on record, and a new application that does not match them compounds the original problem rather than resolving it. If you are inadmissible, a fresh application filed as though nothing happened is the worst available step.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you make a misrepresentation finding go away?',
    a: 'No, and nobody honestly can. Anyone who tells you they can have a finding removed, expedited or overlooked for a fee is describing something that does not exist. We publish a no-guarantee policy for exactly this reason.',

            application, or a decision that refers to misrepresentation, that is the point to obtain
            representation from someone licensed to give Canadian immigration advice — a member in

        <Prose>
          <p>
            When an application is filed, it carries a declaration that the information in it is
            truthful, complete and correct. If an unlicensed agent completes your forms, improves
            your employment history, produces a supporting document, or answers a question in a way
            you never saw, the application still went in under your name and your declaration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The provision covers misrepresentation made directly or indirectly. That wording exists
            precisely so that responsibility cannot be moved onto a third party by handing the file
            to them. In practice the agent is untraceable by the time a letter arrives, has no
            regulator, and bears none of the consequence. You bear all of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is the honest reason to care whether your representative is licensed. A member of
            the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants or a Canadian lawyer is on a
            public register, is subject to a complaints and discipline process, and can be sanctioned
            for the conduct that produces these findings. That is not a guarantee of good behaviour —
            it is a guarantee that there is somewhere to complain. Someone operating outside that
            system is accountable to no one, and the file is in your name.
          </p>
          <p>
            The related consequence is that you should personally read every form before it is
            submitted, and keep your own copy of what was filed. If a representative will not show
            you the complete application before signing, that alone is a reason to stop.

          title="Procedural fairness letters exist — and they are time-limited"
        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Canadian decision-making includes a duty of fairness. Where an officer holds a concern
            that could lead to a finding against you, they may put that concern to you in writing and
            give you an opportunity to respond before deciding. That letter is not a decision. It is
            the opportunity that precedes one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things follow from that, and only two, because the rest is not ours to publish. The
            first is that the window is short and it is real — missing it generally means the decision
            is made without your side of it. The second is that what goes into the response is legal
            work, on your specific facts, and a well-meaning reply written at speed can make the
            position worse rather than better.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will not set out here what such a response should contain, what to concede, what to
            explain, or what evidence to attach. Any page that offers you that is offering legal
            advice about a case it has never seen. Take the letter, with your full application file,
            to a licensed representative.

              It also does not suit anyone who wants to file again quickly and say nothing about what
              happened. A new application inconsistent with your own record compounds the issue rather
              than resolving it. And it does not suit anyone who wants us to confirm that an honest
              mistake ends the matter — it may be highly relevant, but it is not a switch that turns
