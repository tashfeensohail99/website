/**
 * Re-applying after a refusal.
 *
 * The job of this page is to slow people down. The instinct after a refusal is to
 * re-file immediately, usually with the same facts dressed up better. That produces
 * the same answer and adds a second refusal to the record. The page has to be willing
 * to say "not yet" and to explain the disclosure duty before someone quietly omits
 * the refusal from the next form.

    a: 'A refusal is a decision on one application, not a permanent mark of character, and each new application is decided on its own merits.

  {
    q: 'Do I have to declare a refusal from another country?',
    a: 'Yes. Canadian application forms ask about previous refusals of visas or permits, and about being denied entry to or ordered to leave any country — not only Canada.

  {
    q: 'What happens if I do not disclose a previous refusal?',
    a: 'The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act requires applicants to answer questions truthfully and to produce the evidence an officer reasonably requires. Withholding a material fact that could induce an error in administering the Act can support a finding of misrepresentation, which carries a period of inadmissibility set out in the Act — a bar on applying again, not merely a refusal. Assume the previous application is visible. Hiding a refusal converts a survivable problem into a serious one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I ask for reconsideration instead of re-applying?',
    a: 'They answer different problems. Reconsideration asks the same office to look again at a decision already made; a fresh application asks for a decision on a changed set of facts. Which fits depends on what the notes on file actually say, which is why reading them comes first.',

    q: 'The refusal seems unfair. Can I challenge it rather than re-apply?',
    a: 'Possibly. Where the concern is that the decision was legally unreasonable or the process was unfair, the route runs through the Federal Court rather than through another application.

    q: 'Can you tell me whether my new application will succeed?',

          <p>
            A new application is a new decision on a new file. It is not a review of the old one and
            it is not an appeal. The officer deciding it will be able to see that you applied before
            and that you were refused, and will assess the new file against the same requirements as
            the last.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why the instinct most people follow after a refusal — re-file quickly, add more
            documents, write a stronger cover letter — so often fails. It changes the presentation of
            a situation without changing the situation. IRCC itself puts the point bluntly in its{' '}
            <a
              href="https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=1485&top=16"

              help centre
            </a>
            : applying again with the same information — including through a representative — will
            likely not change the decision. If the officer concluded that your ties at home were
            insufficient, a more eloquent explanation of the same ties is still the same ties.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the question to answer before you file anything is narrow and uncomfortable. What is
            materially different now? If the honest answer is nothing, the correct next step is not a
            better application. It is to wait until there is something different, or to accept that
            this route does not currently fit.

              the officer reached that view on your particular facts. Those working notes sit on the

              The dividing line is simple to state and hard to accept: a change is real if it would
              still be true had you never been refused. A job you actually took, a business that
              actually trades, a marriage that actually happened. Anything assembled specifically to
              answer the refusal — and visibly assembled for that purpose — tends to confirm the
              officer’s concern rather than resolve it.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Canadian application forms ask whether you have previously been refused a visa or permit,
            or refused entry to, or ordered to leave, Canada or any other country. The question is
            not limited to Canada and it is not limited to recent events. It has to be answered fully
            and accurately, including refusals arranged or filed by an agent on your behalf.
          </p>
          <p>
            A previous refusal is not, by itself, a bar to anything. Officers see them constantly. A
            file that says <em>I was refused, here is why, and here is what has changed</em> is an
            ordinary file and is dealt with as one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Concealing one is a different matter entirely. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
            obliges applicants to answer truthfully and to produce the evidence an officer reasonably
            requires, and withholding a material fact that could induce an error in administering the
            Act can support a finding of misrepresentation. That finding does not simply refuse the
            application — it carries a fixed period of inadmissibility set out in section 40 of the
            Act, during which further applications are barred. Read the current period at the source
            rather than taking anyone’s word for it. The refusal you were trying to hide was
            survivable on its own terms; a misrepresentation finding is a different order of problem,
            and it is one a licensed representative should look at before you file anything.

              This is among the most damaging advice an applicant can be given, and we are asked
              about it regularly. It is offered as a practical shortcut. It is not one. IRCC can see
              its own record of your prior applications, and the person who
              signs the declaration is you, not the agent who drafted it. The consequence lands on
              you and it lasts far longer than a refusal would have.

              The same applies to documents you did not prepare yourself. An experience letter, bank

              If you have not read the reasons for the refusal, you are not ready. If the only thing
