const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'Is a reconsideration request an appeal?',
    a: 'No. There is no right to it. In Canada (MCI) v. Kurukkal, 2010 FCA 230, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the doctrine of functus officio does not rigidly bar an immigration officer from revisiting a decision — the officer remains free to exercise discretion to reconsider, or to refuse to. Discretion is exactly what it is. IRCC is not obliged to reopen your file, is not obliged to give reasons for declining, and in many cases is not obliged to reply at all.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How likely is it to work?',
    a: 'We will not put a figure on it, and you should distrust anyone who does — nobody publishes reliable success rates for a discretionary request that generates no formal decision. What we can say is what the case law says: the discretion is understood to be for exceptional circumstances, and dissatisfaction or disagreement with the officer’s assessment does not by itself make a case exceptional. A request built on disagreement gives the discretion nothing to act on. Plan the file on the assumption that it will not be reopened.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does asking for reconsideration pause the judicial review deadline?',
    a: 'No, and this is the single most expensive misunderstanding on this page. The deadline for applying to the Federal Court for leave and judicial review is set by statute and runs from the decision. Sending a letter to the visa office does not stop it, suspend it or extend it. An extension is possible only where the Court grants one, and that is a separate application you have to persuade a judge to allow. People routinely wait months for a reply that never comes and find the review route has closed behind them.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I ask for reconsideration or just apply again?',
    a: 'If the refusal identified a genuine weakness and you have since fixed it, a fresh application is usually the more honest route — reconsideration is not a mechanism for submitting the evidence you should have filed the first time. Reconsideration is for cases where the decision itself is flawed on its own terms: something on file was not considered, or a fact was recorded wrongly. If your argument is that the officer should have been more generous, that is not a reconsideration argument.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I do both — request reconsideration and file for judicial review?',
    a: 'It is possible to pursue reconsideration while a judicial review application is on foot, and where the deadline is close that is often the safer structure, because it preserves the route the clock would otherwise close. It also costs more and needs to be planned deliberately rather than drifted into. Decide the strategy before the deadline, not after it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What if my refusal involved a misrepresentation finding?',
    a: 'Then this is the wrong first page. A misrepresentation finding carries consequences well beyond the single refusal and needs to be assessed on its own terms before you send anything to anyone, because a poorly-worded letter can make the record worse. Read our page on misrepresentation findings and get the file looked at before you write.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does IRCC take to answer a reconsideration request?',
    a: 'IRCC publishes processing times for applications, not for reconsideration requests — a request is not an application, so there is nothing for a published time to attach to. Some offices respond, some respond much later, and some do not respond. We will not quote you a typical wait, because there is no official figure to quote. Build your strategy on the assumption that no reply will arrive in time to help you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee a reconsideration will succeed?',
    a: 'No. Nobody can, and a discretionary request is about the least guaranteeable thing in this field. What we can do is tell you honestly whether your file contains the kind of error a request can act on, and if it does not, say so before you spend money on one.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            When a visa office refuses an application, the decision is made. Some refusals do carry a
            statutory right of appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division — refused{' '}
            <Link href="/family-sponsorship" className="font-semibold text-accent-500 link-underline">
              family sponsorships
            </Link>{' '}
            being the category most people encounter. Most temporary-residence refusals do not. Where
            no appeal right exists there is no tribunal to take it to and no second officer who
            reviews the file as a matter of course, so the first thing to establish is which of those
            you are in.
          </p>
          <p>
            What exists alongside that is a narrow discretion. In{' '}
            <em>Canada (MCI) v. Kurukkal</em>, 2010 FCA 230, the Federal Court of Appeal held that an
            immigration officer is not rigidly barred from revisiting a decision, and remains free to
            exercise discretion to reconsider — or to refuse to. A reconsideration request is simply
            you asking the office to exercise that discretion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note the shape of that. It is a request, not a filing. It creates no obligation on IRCC
            to reopen anything, no obligation to explain a decision not to, and no entitlement to a
            reply. It is not adjudicated by anyone independent of the office that refused you. And
            because it is not an application, nothing about it is on a timetable you can rely on.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is not a reason never to send one. It is a reason to send one only when you have
            something specific for it to act on — and never as a substitute for the two routes that
            actually have teeth.

          <p>
            The statutory route for challenging an IRCC decision is an application to the Federal
            Court for leave and judicial review. That route has a filing deadline fixed by
            legislation, running from when the decision was communicated to you, and it is short.

          </p>
          <p>
            Sending a reconsideration request has no effect on that deadline whatsoever. It does not
            pause it, restart it, or provide an excuse for missing it. The Court can extend time,
            but only if you ask and only if a judge is persuaded — which is a separate argument you
            then have to win before anyone looks at the merits of your case.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pattern we see is depressingly consistent. Someone is refused, sends a polite letter
            asking the office to reconsider, waits, sends a follow-up, waits again, and by the time
            they accept that no answer is coming, the deadline has gone. The reconsideration was
            never likely to succeed, and it quietly consumed the one route that might have.

            <p>
              Whatever you decide to do, establish the date by which a Federal Court application
              would have to be filed, and establish it first. Every other decision — request, fresh
              application, court — sits inside that constraint. If you are close to it, the request
              is the thing that waits, not the court filing.

                the fees again and starting over — and reapplying without first understanding why you

            <strong>Treating the request as an appeal.</strong> People send it expecting a process:
            an acknowledgement, a file number, a review, a reply. None of that is owed. When nothing
            arrives, they assume it is still under review. Silence is not evidence that it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Letting the court deadline lapse while waiting.</strong> The most costly error
            on this page, and the one that cannot be undone without persuading a judge to extend
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sending the request without reading the reasoning.</strong> If you do not know
            what the officer considered, you cannot credibly claim something was overlooked. Requests
            drafted from the refusal letter alone tend to argue against findings the officer never
            made.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Attaching a pile of new documents.</strong> A request that arrives with fresh
            bank statements and fresh employment letters reads as a second application, and risks
            being treated as one. It also tends to concede the officer’s point rather than
            challenge it — which, if that is where you actually are, is an argument for refiling.

            <strong>Agents selling it as a service with an implied outcome.</strong> Because a
            request is cheap to write and there is no formal decision to point to when it fails, it
            is easy to charge for and easy to blame on the office. If someone offers a
            reconsideration package and talks about success rates, ask them to put the discretionary
            nature of it in writing.

            <strong>Repeat requests.</strong> Sending a second and third letter after silence adds
            nothing to the file and consumes the weeks you needed for something else.

              A reconsideration request needs a specific, demonstrable defect in the decision —
              something on file that was not considered, or a fact recorded wrongly. If your position
              is that the officer was too strict, or that you deserve another chance, or that you can
              now provide what was missing, there is nothing here for the discretion to act on, and
              your time and money are almost certainly better spent on one of the other two routes.

              It also does not suit anyone close to the judicial review deadline who intends to wait
              for a reply before deciding — the waiting is the risk. It does not suit anyone whose
              refusal involves a{' '}

              , which needs separate handling before anything is sent. And it does not suit anyone
              who has simply not yet read what the officer actually wrote.

              We would rather tell you on the first call that a request has nothing to work with than

          <p>
            We start with the refusal and its date, and establish what your remaining options are and
            how long each of them is open for. That is a short conversation and it frequently changes
            what people were about to do.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then we read the reasoning — the letter, its attachments, and where it is warranted the
            officer’s notes — and decide whether there is a defect a request can act on, whether the
            file is better refiled, or whether the matter belongs in front of the Federal Court. If
            more than one of those is live, we say which order they go in.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a request is worth sending, it is drafted narrowly around the specific error, with the
            evidence that establishes it and nothing else. If it is not worth sending, we tell you,
            and we do not charge you to write it anyway.
