 * The tools hub.

 * Free tools are the one thing on an immigration site people actually come back
 * to, and they qualify a lead better than any brochure page can. Every tool here
 * ends the same way: an honest band, the specific weak points, and a WhatsApp
 * message pre-filled with the person's own answers so the rep starts informed.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a wall of twenty calculators for programmes the firm doesn't
 * file. Each tool maps to something we actually handle.

              These tools ask a handful of questions. A real assessment means someone qualified
              reading your actual documents — your business records, your bank history, your refusal
              letter. No questionnaire replaces that, and ours doesn’t pretend to.
            </p>
            <p>
              What they are genuinely good for is saving you time and money: finding out in sixty
              seconds whether a route is even worth a conversation, and which parts of your file are
              weak enough to fix first.

              A tool that tells everyone they qualify is a lead generator, not an assessment. Ours
              will tell you when a route doesn’t fit — because a refusal on your record costs you far
              more than a lost enquiry costs us.
