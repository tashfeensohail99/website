  },
  {
    q: 'Is this checker a decision?',
    a: 'No. It is an indicative self-assessment based on six questions. A real assessment means a lawyer reading your actual documents. What the tool is good for is telling you quickly whether this is worth a conversation at all.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens after I get a result?',
    a: 'Nothing automatic. You can send the result to us on WhatsApp — it arrives with your answers attached, so we already understand your situation — or book a free consultation. Either way you are under no obligation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a previous refusal rule me out?',
    a: 'Not automatically, but it must be dealt with openly in the new application. Applications that quietly ignore an earlier refusal tend to collect a second one.',

              The route is designed around an owner-operator: someone who runs a business, can fund
              an operation in Canada, and will actually run it rather than park money in it. That is
              why the checker asks about ownership, track record and funding rather than about
              points.

              It is genuinely demanding, and it is not right for everyone — which is exactly why we
              would rather you find that out from a free tool than from an invoice.

              No questionnaire — ours included — can tell you whether you will get a visa. A visa
              officer decides that. What a good assessment does is tell you honestly whether your
              case is worth building, and what would have to be true for it to work.{' '}
