  },
  {
    q: 'How much money do I need to show?',
    a: 'It depends entirely on which route you are on, how many people are in your family, and in some cases which province you are going to. Settlement fund requirements are published by IRCC and updated periodically. We confirm the current figure for your specific route and family size rather than putting a number on a web page you might read a year from now.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What do the government fees come to?',
    a: 'Government fees are set by IRCC and paid to IRCC, not to us. They differ by application type and by the number of people included. IRCC publishes the current fee schedule on its site. Separately, our professional fee is quoted in writing for your own file before you commit to anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I apply to more than one route at the same time?',
    a: 'Sometimes, and sometimes it is actively unwise — parallel applications can conflict, can raise questions about your stated intention, and can double your exposure if one goes wrong. It is a judgement call on your specific facts, not a general strategy to adopt by default.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I have a previous refusal. Does that close everything off?',
    a: 'Not automatically, but it does change how the next application has to be built. A refusal on your record is read by the next officer, and an application that ignores it rarely does well. It has to be addressed directly and honestly.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee permanent residence?',
    a: (
      <>
        No. The decision is made by an IRCC officer and no consultant, in Pakistan or in Canada, can
        overrule that. What we can do is tell you honestly whether a route is realistic for you and

              An agent who only files one kind of application will find that you qualify for it. That
              is the single most expensive thing that happens to applicants from Pakistan — not fraud,
              just narrowness. You spend a year and a fee on the one route the person in front of you
              knew how to sell.
            </p>
            <p>
              The routes below are families, not products. Each one starts from the same set of facts
              about you — your age, your education, your language ability, your real work history,
              your funds, your relatives in Canada — and weighs them differently. A profile that is
              mediocre in one family can be strong in another.

              Read them to work out which families are even plausible for you. Then the useful
              question is not “can I get in?” but “which of these two or three should I actually
              file, and what do I have to fix first?”

              Two things worth knowing about this list. First, the boundaries between families are
              porous — a work permit can produce the experience an economic route needs, and a
              provincial nomination can transform a federal profile. Second, the detailed rules
              inside each family change often, particularly at provincial level. Anything you read
