  {
    q: 'Does studying in Canada lead to permanent residence?',
    a: 'It can, but nothing about a study permit creates an entitlement to it. A study permit is temporary authorisation to study. Permanent residence is a separate decision, under a separate programme, made years later against criteria that will have changed in the meantime. People do make the transition every year; people also finish, fail to find skilled work, and go home.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is a post-graduation work permit automatic once I graduate?',
    a: 'No. It is an application that can be refused. Eligibility depends on the institution, the programme, how you studied, your status at the time and — for some categories of programme — the field of study and language requirements IRCC applies. Many refusals trace back to a choice made at admission stage, before the applicant knew any of this mattered.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does the whole path take?',
    a: 'Longer than most people are told, and we will not print a figure. Study is followed by a work permit application, then by a period of qualifying employment, then by a permanent residence application with its own processing. Plan on years, and plan for the possibility that it does not complete.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does the work I do while studying count toward permanent residence?',
    a: 'Generally not for the economic route international graduates most often use. Experience gained while you were a full-time student, including co-op placements, is normally excluded from the qualifying Canadian experience that class counts. IRCC sets out the exclusions on its Canadian Experience Class eligibility page at canada.ca, and they are worth reading before you rely on part-time hours.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does any programme at any school qualify?',
    a: 'No. The institution must be designated, and beyond that only certain programmes lead to a post-graduation work permit. For some categories of programme, eligibility is tied to a published list of fields linked to labour shortages, and that list is revised. Verify the specific programme against IRCC’s current requirements before you pay a deposit — not after.',
  },
  {
    q: 'An agent has offered me a study-to-PR package. Is that real?',
    a: 'No one can package a permanent residence outcome, because it depends on multiple independent government decisions and on your own performance in the Canadian labour market. What can be sold honestly is admission support, an application prepared properly, and an assessment of whether the plan is realistic. Any offer that describes permanent residence as included is describing something the seller cannot deliver.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if I finish and cannot find skilled work?',
    a: 'The work permit expires and you are expected to leave. This is an ordinary outcome, not an exotic failure case, and it is why the honest question to ask before enrolling is whether you could afford the study on its own terms if permanent residence never followed.',

          <p>
            International graduates do become permanent residents of Canada. The mechanism is not a
            student-to-resident programme, though — there is no such thing. What exists is a chain: you
            study, you apply for a work permit that some graduates qualify for, you use it to build
            skilled Canadian work experience, and that experience is what an economic immigration
            programme values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each link is its own application, assessed on its own criteria, by a decision-maker who owes
            nothing to the previous stage. Completing a degree does not entitle you to the work permit.
            Holding the work permit does not entitle you to skilled employment. Holding skilled
            employment does not entitle you to permanent residence.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is not pessimism, it is the structure. Understanding it changes the decisions you make
            at the very start — which institution, which programme, which province — because those are
            the choices that quietly determine whether the later stages are available to you at all.

              Whether a post-graduation work permit will be available to you depends on the institution
              being designated, on the programme itself being one that leads to a permit, and — for
              certain categories of programme — on the field of study and on language requirements IRCC

              This route does not suit anyone who is borrowing heavily, selling property, or committing
              family savings on the understanding that permanent residence is the return. It is a
              multi-year sequence with a real chance of ending at any stage, and the only thing you are
              certain to receive in exchange for the money is the education itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also tends not to suit applicants who already hold strong skilled experience and
              language results — for them, applying directly under an economic programme may be a
              shorter and less expensive question to ask first, before paying for a degree they may not
              need. It does not suit people whose
              intended occupation is not one Canadian provinces are short of, and it does not suit anyone
              choosing a programme for admission ease rather than for what it leads to.

              We would rather tell you on the first call that studying is the wrong instrument for your
              goal than take a fee for a plan that was never going to reach the end of the chain. If your
              real objective is permanent residence, start at{' '}

            Eligible programmes and fields of study, language requirements, application windows,
            selection criteria and provincial stream definitions all change, sometimes at short notice
            and sometimes mid-way through a student’s programme. We deliberately do not publish those
            details here, because a page you read a year from now would be quietly wrong.
