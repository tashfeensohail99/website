    a: 'IRCC defines this by study level, programme type and institution, and it has changed more than once in recent years.

  {
    q: 'My spouse was approved for an open work permit before the rules changed. Is it still valid?',
    a: 'A permit that was issued remains valid on its own terms until it expires. The question that catches people is renewal: an extension is assessed against the criteria in force at the time you apply, not the ones that applied when the first permit was granted. Plan the second permit before the first one runs out.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does my child need their own study permit?',
    a: 'For a family applying from Pakistan, usually yes. IRCC’s published guidance is that minor children who intend to study should apply for a study permit before entering Canada, including children coming with a parent who is applying for a study or work permit — and in that situation a letter of acceptance is generally not required with the child’s application. The exemption people have heard about, which allows a minor to attend primary or secondary school without a permit while accompanied by a parent authorised to study or work, is narrower than it is usually described and is not a safe basis on which to plan an arrival from abroad. Read IRCC’s minor children page, linked below, and confirm your own situation before you decide. Separately, once a child reaches the age of majority in their province or moves on to post-secondary study, they are assessed as an applicant in their own right.',

  {
    q: 'Will bringing my family make my own study permit harder to get?',
    a: 'It changes what an officer is assessing. The financial requirement is larger, and the officer is weighing whether an entire household will leave at the end of the authorised stay. Those two grounds are the ones we most often see cited on the refusal letters clients bring us. It is not a reason to hide family members — that is misrepresentation — but it is a reason to prepare the file properly.',

    q: 'Can I bring my parents on my study permit?',

          <p>
            People often describe this as “taking the family on my student visa”. That is not how it
            works. Your study permit is one application. Your spouse’s status is another. Each child’s
            status is another again. They are usually filed together and assessed together, but they
            are distinct decisions and they can come back differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one point worth internalising before you spend anything: enrolling in a Canadian
            programme does not, by itself, entitle your spouse to work. For a period, spousal open work
            permits were available to the partners of most international students. That is no longer
            the case. Eligibility now turns on the level and type of programme you are enrolled in and
            the kind of institution delivering it, and it has been tightened more than once.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your household budget assumes your spouse will earn in Canada, verify the current
            criteria against your specific programme before you accept an offer or pay a deposit.
            Getting that wrong is not a paperwork problem — it changes whether the plan is affordable
            at all.

              A spouse and dependent children must be declared on your application whether or not they
              accompany you. This is not a formality. Two distinct risks follow from getting it wrong.
              The immediate one is misrepresentation: material information withheld from an application
              carries consequences set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. The second
              arises much later — the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations restrict
              sponsoring a family member who was not examined when they should have been on an earlier
              application. Both are matters to put to a licensed representative on the facts, not to
              resolve from a web page.

              The same applies to a marriage that takes place after you file. Tell IRCC. Quietly

                An open work permit is not tied to a named employer, which is why it matters so much to
                a family’s finances. For the spouse of an international student, it is available only
                where the student’s programme falls within the categories IRCC currently allows —
                defined by study level, programme type and institution.
              </p>
              <p>
                The direction of travel has been consistently narrower. Partners of students in
                shorter, lower-level or non-university programmes have progressively fallen outside the
                criteria, and the instructions have also been refined in ways that affect students near
                the end of their studies. Treat any list you find on a blog, including a recent one, as
                out of date until you have checked it against IRCC.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where a spouse does not qualify, the realistic alternatives are that they accompany you
                as a visitor and do not work, that they qualify for a work permit in their own right on
                an unrelated basis, or that they remain in Pakistan while you study. All three are
                legitimate plans. Assuming the first one includes a right to work is not.

          <p>
            The most common misunderstanding here is that children are simply carried along on the
            parent’s permit. They are not. IRCC’s guidance is that a minor child who intends to study
            should apply for a study permit before entering Canada, including a child arriving with a
            parent who is applying for a study or work permit. A useful concession applies in that
            case: the child’s application does not generally need a letter of acceptance, and it can be
            filed alongside the parent’s as a family group.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a separate, narrower exemption allowing a minor accompanied by a parent authorised
            to study or work in Canada to attend primary or secondary school without holding a permit
            of their own. It is real, but it is written for children already in Canada, and it is
            routinely quoted to families arriving from abroad as though it removed the need to apply.
            Do not build an arrival plan on it without checking your own circumstances against IRCC’s
            page, linked below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things reliably catch families out. The first is the age of majority, which is set by
            each province rather than federally: once a child passes it, or moves into post-secondary
            study, they need their own study permit and are assessed as an applicant in their own right.
            The second is school itself — admission, catchment and any fees charged for the children of
            temporary residents are decided by the province and the school board, not by IRCC. Ask the
            board directly before you assume a place, and before you assume it is free.

          <p>
            <strong>A budget built on a spousal salary that never materialises.</strong> The most
            expensive mistake on this page. Families commit to tuition and a deposit on the assumption
            of two incomes in Canada, discover the spouse does not qualify, and are left funding a
            household on one student’s permitted hours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Relying on an outdated eligibility list.</strong> Agents and blog posts repeat
            criteria that were accurate at some point. The rules for spouses of students have moved
            repeatedly. Only IRCC’s current page is authoritative, on the day you read it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Funds that are not credibly the family’s.</strong> Supporting a spouse and children
            raises what you must demonstrate. Money that appears shortly before filing, or belongs to
            someone with no obligation to you, invites refusal on financial grounds regardless of the
            balance shown.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Family accompaniment read as intent to stay.</strong> Officers assess whether the
            household will leave at the end of the authorised stay. Moving an entire family makes that
            question sharper. It is answered with a coherent account of your studies and your ties, not
            by pretending the family does not exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Statuses that drift out of alignment.</strong> A spouse’s or child’s status is tied
            to the student’s and generally cannot extend beyond it. Extensions filed late, or filed for
            only one member of the household, are a routine cause of people losing status quietly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming a refusal for one is a refusal for all — or is unreviewable.</strong> It is
            neither. Where a family member is refused,{' '}

            are the route to understanding which ground actually failed, and that is what determines

              Studying in Canada with a family attached does not suit someone whose finances depend on a
              spousal income that is not yet confirmed as available. It does not suit someone choosing a
              short or lower-level programme primarily to get the family into Canada — those programmes

            Spousal work permit criteria, the financial requirement for accompanying family members,
            application fees and processing times all change, and the criteria for spouses of students
            have changed more than most. We deliberately do not publish those figures or lists here,
            because something that is right today becomes a liability on a page you read next year.
