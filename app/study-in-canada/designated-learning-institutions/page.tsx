 * Designated learning institutions.

 * The job of this page is to separate two things students routinely merge:
 * "can I get a study permit to go here" and "will this get me a work permit
 * afterwards". The first is about the institution. The second is about the
 * institution AND the programme. An agent with a commission has an incentive

    q: 'Can I get a study permit for a school that is not a DLI?',
    a: 'No. Post-secondary study permit applications rest on an acceptance from a designated institution. Without designation there is no application to make.',
  },
  {
    q: 'If the school is a DLI, am I guaranteed a work permit after I graduate?',
    a: 'No, and it is a costly misunderstanding. Post-graduation work permit eligibility depends on the type of institution, on the specific programme and its field of study, on how the programme was delivered, and on requirements IRCC has revised more than once. A designated school can lawfully enrol you on a programme that leads to no work permit at all. Read the current requirements on IRCC’s post-graduation work permit eligibility pages, and our own post-graduation work permit page, and confirm the specific programme before you commit.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are private colleges designated?',
    a: 'Some are and some are not, and designation is decided province by province. Private career colleges are the category where the gap between "designated" and "leads to a work permit" is widest. Arrangements where a private college delivers a public institution’s curriculum under licence have been a specific area of restriction — treat any such arrangement as something to verify carefully rather than assume.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I know my agent is not steering me?',
    a: 'Ask a direct question: how are you paid if I enrol here. Recruiters are commonly paid a commission by the institution, and the schools that pay the most are not usually the ones with the strongest outcomes. If the answer is evasive, or if every student in the office is being sent to the same two colleges, you are being placed rather than advised.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if my school loses its designation while I am studying?',
    a: 'It affects you directly, and the practical consequences fall on the permit and on the credential rather than being resolved by the school. This is a situation to get advice on immediately rather than to wait out, because the options narrow as your permit runs down. IRCC publishes guidance on what students in this position should do.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does the DLI number matter on the application?',
    a: 'Yes. It identifies the institution to IRCC, and it must correspond to the school and campus on your acceptance letter. Errors here are worth catching before filing rather than explaining afterwards.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I change schools after I arrive?',
    a: 'Not by simply telling IRCC you have moved. For post-secondary students, IRCC’s rules require you to apply for — and be approved for — a new study permit before you begin studying at a different designated institution; carrying on at a new school without that approval puts you out of status. The current procedure is set out on IRCC’s "Changing your school or program" page, and it should be read there rather than taken from an agent. Moving can also affect your later work permit eligibility, so it is not an administrative transfer and it should not be your fallback for a school you already doubt.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Education in Canada is a provincial responsibility. Immigration is federal. A designated
            learning institution is where the two meet: the province or territory approves a school
            to host international students, and IRCC then accepts an acceptance letter from that
            school as the basis for a study permit application.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every designated institution is given a DLI number. That number goes on your acceptance
            letter and on your application, and it is how IRCC identifies where you say you are
            going. IRCC publishes the full list of designated institutions, arranged by province and
            territory, on its own site.
          </p>
          <p>
            What designation is not: it is not a quality rating, it is not an assurance that the
            credential is respected by Canadian employers, and it is not a promise that the
            programme you have been sold leads anywhere. Provinces designate schools against
            administrative criteria. A school can be perfectly properly designated and still be a
            poor use of several years and a great deal of money.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>Commission, not fit.</strong> International student recruitment runs on
            commission paid by institutions to agents. That is legal and openly practised. But it
            means the recommendation you receive is shaped by what the school pays, and the schools
            that pay most are rarely the ones with the strongest graduate outcomes. If every student
            walking out of an office is heading to the same two private colleges, the selection was
            not made on merit.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>“It’s on the DLI list” used as the whole answer.</strong> It is a true statement
            that answers a narrower question than the one you were asking. Ask instead whether the
            specific programme supports a post-graduation work permit, and get the answer from the
            institution in writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A programme chosen for admission, not for a career.</strong> Some programmes are
            easy to get into precisely because demand for them is thin. A cheap, quick, easily
            accepted credential in a field with no Canadian demand tends to leave you with debt, a
            qualification employers do not recognise, and no route onward.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Campus and delivery not checked.</strong> Designation attaches to institutions
            and campuses. Where a programme is delivered, and by whom, can change the outcome
            entirely — most visibly where a private college delivers another institution’s
            curriculum under an arrangement between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>An acceptance letter nobody verified.</strong> Fraudulent and altered acceptance
            letters exist, and IRCC verifies letters with institutions. Presenting one — even one
            you were handed in good faith by an agent — is misrepresentation, and the consequence
            lands on you, not on the agent.{' '}

              A great many people we speak to do not want to study. They want to live in Canada, and
              study has been sold to them as the way in. It can be a route, but it is one of the
              most expensive and least certain ones: tuition at international rates, living costs,
              years out of the workforce, and a work permit at the end that is conditional rather
