/**
 * Canadian study permit — the application end to end.
 *
 * The organising idea: applicants treat this as a document-collection exercise,
 * and officers treat it as a credibility assessment. The page exists to move the
 * reader from the first view to the second, because that is where refusals come
 * from. Deliberately no fund amounts, no fees, no processing times, no dates of
 * past rule changes, and no fixed list of attestation-letter exemptions — that
 * list is revised periodically. Everything volatile is linked to IRCC instead.

    q: 'How much money do I need to show?',
    a: 'There is a required amount, it varies by circumstances such as where you will study and how many people are coming with you, and IRCC revises it. We do not print it here because a figure that is correct today becomes a trap on a page you read next year. Read the current requirement on IRCC’s own site on the day you prepare your file — and understand that meeting the number is the floor, not the argument.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does a study permit take?',
    a: 'IRCC publishes current processing times by country and updates them, and they move with volume and season. Any timeline quoted to you privately by an agent is a guess. Plan around your programme start date and apply as early as your acceptance allows.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a provincial attestation letter?',
    a: 'Many post-secondary applicants do, but several categories of applicant are exempt, and IRCC has revised which categories those are more than once. Because it changes, check the current position on IRCC’s attestation-letter page and ask the institution, which is usually the party that actually requests it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I work while I study?',
    a: 'A study permit can carry work authorisation as a condition, on and off campus, subject to limits on hours and to remaining enrolled and in good standing. Whether it applies to you, and what the limit is, is set by IRCC and has been changed more than once — read the current rule on IRCC’s working-while-studying page rather than relying on what a previous cohort was allowed. Never plan your finances on the assumption that part-time work will cover the gap — officers expect you to be funded without it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a study permit lead to permanent residence?',
    a: 'It is not a permanent residence application and does not become one automatically. Canadian study and subsequent Canadian work experience can strengthen a later application through several routes, but each has its own requirements and none is promised to you by being admitted to a course.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My previous study permit was refused. Can I apply again?',
    a: 'Yes, but only if something has genuinely changed. Re-filing the same file with a longer letter attached usually produces the same result, and a pattern of refusals becomes its own problem. The first step is to obtain the officer’s actual reasoning through the notes before deciding anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee my study permit will be approved?',
    a: 'No, and nobody can. The decision is a visa officer’s judgement about you, made on the file in front of them. What we can do is tell you before you spend money whether the plan you are describing is one an officer is likely to find coherent.',

      {/* ===================== WHAT IT IS ===================== */}
      <Section tone="paper">
        <SectionHeading eyebrow="The route, plainly" title="What a study permit is, and what it is not" />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            A study permit is temporary authorisation to study in Canada at a designated learning
            institution. It is issued for a purpose and a period, it names conditions, and it expects
            you to leave at the end of the time allowed unless you have obtained some other status by
            then.
          </p>
          <p>
            That last point is where most applicants are surprised. The governing regulation requires
            the officer to be satisfied that you will depart Canada by the end of your authorised
            stay. So the officer is weighing two things at once: that you are a genuine student, and
            that you are a temporary one. Applicants who present the permit as a first step to
            settling in Canada are answering the second question badly without realising it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The permit is also not a visa on its own. Where a visa or electronic authorisation is
            required for travel, that is issued alongside it. What an approval gives you is a letter of
            introduction; the permit itself is issued by a border services officer when you arrive in
            Canada, and that officer makes the final decision on admitting you.

                An officer reading your file is not auditing a checklist. They are forming a view about
                whether the story holds together: this person, with this education and this work
                history, choosing this programme, at this school, at this stage of their life, funded
                this way, and returning to this.
              </p>
              <p>
                When any one of those elements sits oddly against the others, the whole file weakens.
                A graduate with a master’s degree enrolling in an unrelated entry-level diploma. An
                applicant whose funding appears from a relative with no obvious reason to fund them.
                A programme available at home for a fraction of the cost, with no explanation of what
                the Canadian version adds.
              </p>
              <p>
                None of these are dishonest. They are simply incoherent, and incoherence reads as
                something else being the real purpose of the trip.

              This is the point applicants resist most. When a study plan does not make sense for the person presenting it, adding
              documents does not repair it. A larger bank balance, a longer letter, more property
              papers, an additional affidavit — none of it addresses the officer’s actual concern,
              which is about the logic of the plan rather than the volume of the file.

              If your programme choice cannot be explained in three honest sentences that a stranger

            <strong>A study plan written by somebody else.</strong> Consultant-drafted statements share
            a vocabulary and a shape that officers read constantly. Worse, they contain claims about
            your motivations that you cannot support if asked. Your own plainer words are stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A programme chosen because it was easy to get into.</strong> Admission is not the
            test. If the course does not follow from your degree, your job, or a stated change of
            direction you can explain, the acceptance letter works against you rather than for you.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Funds that arrived last month.</strong> A sudden deposit with no traceable origin
            is the most common financial finding. Officers look at the history of the account and the
            plausibility of the sponsor, not the closing balance on the day you took the statement.

          <p>
            <strong>Documents obtained rather than earned.</strong> An arranged experience letter, an
            inflated transcript, an unearned language result. This is misrepresentation, and it carries
            a bar on future applications that outlasts the course you were applying for.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reapplying without knowing why you were refused.</strong> The letter you receive is
            a summary. The officer’s reasoning sits in the notes on file, and reapplying without it is
            guessing.{' '}

              A study permit is a poor immigration strategy for someone whose real objective is to
              work or settle. It is expensive, it commits you to years of tuition, the plan has to
              withstand a credibility assessment you cannot fake convincingly, and the conditions
              follow you after arrival. Where the stated purpose and the real one diverge, that is
              exactly what the credibility assessment is looking for — and applicants who get through
              on a plan they did not want are often unhappy with what they committed to.
