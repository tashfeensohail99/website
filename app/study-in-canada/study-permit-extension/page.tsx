  {
    q: 'What exactly is maintained status?',
    a: 'If you applied to extend before your permit expired and you remain in Canada, you may generally continue under the conditions of your expired permit while the application is pending. It is a continuation of what you already had — not an upgrade. It does not let you start studying at an institution the old permit did not authorise, and it does not give you conditions you did not previously hold.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I travel while my extension is pending?',
    a: 'This is where students most often get caught. Maintained status depends on remaining in Canada. If you leave, you may well be able to re-enter — assuming your travel document or visa is valid — but the protection that let you keep studying does not come back with you. The usual outcome is that you are in Canada lawfully and cannot resume studying until a decision is made. Do not treat a pending extension as travel insurance. Take advice before booking.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My permit expired before I applied. What now?',
    a: 'You are out of status, and you should get advice the same week rather than the same month. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations provide for restoration — an application to have status restored — but it is available only within a short fixed window after status is lost, and only if you still meet the requirements of the stay and have not breached other conditions. It is discretionary. Nobody can promise it will succeed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I keep studying or working while out of status?',
    a: 'No. Once status is lost, the authorisation to study and any work authorisation attached to it end with it. Continuing to study or work after that point is a further breach, and it makes the restoration application materially harder. Stop, then get advice.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does an extension application affect my post-graduation work permit?',
    a: 'It can. Eligibility for a post-graduation work permit depends heavily on holding valid status at the right moments and on studying at an eligible institution under a valid permit throughout. A gap in status during your studies is one of the things that most reliably causes problems later, long after the gap itself is closed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will you tell me how long an extension takes?',
    a: 'No, and you should be wary of anyone who does. IRCC publishes current processing times on its own site and they move. Any number we printed here would be wrong within months and you might plan a travel booking or a job start around it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee my extension will be approved?',
    a: 'No. An extension is a fresh decision by an officer, assessed against the same requirements as the original permit. We can tell you honestly whether your file is in reasonable shape and what is likely to be questioned. We publish a no-guarantee policy for precisely this reason.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            A study permit authorises you to study in Canada until a stated point, under stated
            conditions. It does not stretch to fit your programme, it does not renew because you are
            still enrolled, and it does not pause because your university is slow with a letter. When
            that point passes without a decision or a valid application behind it, your legal status in
            Canada ends. And the point is not always the date printed on the permit — completing your
            studies can bring it forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            That matters more than students usually expect, because status is cumulative. A gap now is
            not a self-contained problem that closes when you get a new permit. It sits in your
            immigration history and resurfaces later — in a work permit application, in a permanent
            residence application, at a port of entry, sometimes years afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Letting status lapse is one of the most damaging things an international student can do to
            their own file, and it is almost always avoidable. It is nearly always the result of
            leaving the extension too late rather than of any hard eligibility problem.

              The document in your passport that let you travel to Canada and the study permit that
              authorises you to study here are two different things with two different dates. Students
              regularly plan around the visa. The permit is the one that governs your right to study.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a second trap underneath that. A study permit does not always run to its printed
              date: under IRCC’s rules it also stops being valid a set period after you complete your
              programme, whichever comes first — and completion can be triggered by something as
              ordinary as your school issuing final results. Students who finish early are the ones

                If IRCC receives your extension application before your current permit expires, and you
                remain in Canada, you may generally continue under the conditions of that expiring
                permit until a decision is made. This is usually called maintained status; older
                material calls it implied status.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is a continuation, not a new authorisation. It carries forward the conditions you
                already held — the institution named on the old permit, and any work authorisation that
                came with it — and nothing more. If you are asking IRCC for something different from
                what you had, maintained status does not give it to you early.
              </p>
              <p>
                The conditions attached to this protection have been adjusted by IRCC more than once.
                Check the current position on the IRCC page before relying on it, rather than on what a

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            If your permit expired and no valid application was in place, you are out of status. The
            Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations provide a route back: an application to
            restore temporary resident status. It exists, it is real, and it should not be thought of as
            a fallback plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three features of restoration matter. It is <strong>time-limited</strong> — the Regulations
            set a short fixed window after status is lost, and once that window closes the route closes
            with it. It is <strong>conditional</strong> — you must still meet the requirements of the
            stay you are asking to have restored, and you must not have breached other conditions
            imposed on you. And it is <strong>discretionary</strong> — an officer decides. A complete,
            timely restoration application is not the same thing as a restored status.
          </p>
          <p>
            While you are out of status you have no authorisation to study and no authorisation to work.
            Continuing to do either is a further breach, and it is one of the more common reasons a
            restoration application fails. If you have already lost status, stop studying and stop
            working first, then get advice — in that order, and quickly, because the window is short.
          </p>

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>Waiting for the university letter.</strong> Students delay applying because a
            department has not issued the enrolment confirmation. The permit expires while they wait.
            Chase the letter and file on time; a follow-up document is a smaller problem than a lapse.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Reading the visa date instead of the permit date.</strong> Two documents, two dates.
            This mistake is common and entirely preventable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming the printed expiry date is yours to use.</strong> Finishing your programme
            early can end the permit before the date on its face. Students who accelerate, transfer
            credits or complete over a summer term are the ones who lose status while still holding a
            permit that looks valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Travelling while the extension is pending.</strong> A trip home over a break,
            booked before the application was filed, ends the protection that was doing the work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Changing institution quietly.</strong> Moving school or level of study without
            addressing the conditions on the permit is treated as a compliance issue, not a paperwork
            one — and it surfaces later, at exactly the wrong moment. The requirements here have been
            tightened, and there are exceptions; read{' '}

            planning around a stale timeline is exactly how status gets lost.
