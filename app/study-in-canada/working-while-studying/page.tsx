The general shape is that a placement genuinely required to complete the programme, and forming only part of it rather than the bulk, is assessed differently from an ordinary job. Whether that means your study permit is enough, or a separate document is still needed, must be read on IRCC’s own student-work pages and confirmed with your institution’s international student office before the placement starts — not after.',

Depending on the case, consequences can include loss of student status, refusal of a future study, work or permanent residence application, a finding of non-compliance or inadmissibility, and having to leave Canada. It can also surface much later: later applications ask about your work history, and answering them inaccurately raises a misrepresentation issue on top of the original breach. What follows in any individual case is IRCC’s decision, not something we or anyone else can predict for you.',

    q: 'My employer pays cash and says nobody checks. Is that safer?',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            A study permit is not only permission to study. It is a document that carries conditions,
            and those conditions are printed on it. Among them is whether you may accept employment,
            and where — on the campus of your institution, off campus, or both.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters more than it sounds. Most permits issued to eligible post-secondary students
            do carry work conditions, which is exactly why students stop checking and start assuming.
            But the assumption is not the authority. If the condition is absent from your document,
            you have no permission to work, regardless of what your classmates’ permits say or what
            an employer tells you is normal.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the first step is not a search for jobs. It is reading the conditions on your own
            permit, in the wording IRCC actually used, and knowing what they allow. If the condition
            is missing and you believe you are eligible, there is a process for asking IRCC to amend
            the permit — and you cannot work while you wait for it.

                Off-campus permission is conditional and continuing. It is not granted once and held
                forever — it depends on facts about your enrolment that can change during the year
                without any notice being issued to you.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is the trap. Nobody writes to tell a student that their permission lapsed when
                they dropped to part-time or paused a semester. The permission simply stops applying,
                and the shifts worked afterwards are unauthorised.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your enrolment status changes for any reason — a failed term, a medical leave, a
                transfer, a change of programme — treat your work permission as something to re-check
                rather than something to carry over.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Some programmes cannot be completed without a work placement. Engineering co-ops, nursing
            and education practicums, hospitality placements and many applied diplomas are built that
            way: the placement is a graduation requirement, not an optional extra.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the work is part of the curriculum, it is treated separately from ordinary
            off-campus employment. For a long time it required its own document, applied for alongside
            or after the study permit. IRCC has since revised that position, and it has not applied the
            same way at every level of study — so this is precisely the point on which older advice,
            including advice from people who studied in Canada a few years ago, goes wrong. Whether a
            separate permit is needed for your placement is a question to answer today, from{' '}

            , not from anything written a year ago — including this page.
          </p>
          <p>
            The conditions that have remained stable in kind are these: the placement must be genuinely
            required to complete the programme, your institution must be able to confirm that in
            writing, you must hold a valid study permit, the placement must form only part of the
            programme rather than the bulk of it (IRCC sets the exact proportion, and it is published on
            the page linked above), and certain placements — those in healthcare, childcare, or other
            settings where public health is a factor — can carry a medical examination requirement that
            has to be dealt with before the placement, not during it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confirm the position with your institution’s international student office and with IRCC
            before the placement begins. A placement started on the wrong footing is difficult to
            unwind, because the work is already on your record and the term is already in progress.

          <p>
            <strong>Starting work before the programme starts.</strong> Off-campus permission runs from
            the actual start of studies. Shifts worked in the weeks between arrival and the first day
            of classes are unauthorised, and students take them precisely because money is tightest
            then.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Two part-time jobs, counted separately.</strong> The weekly ceiling applies to all
            your off-campus work combined, not to each employer. Two employers who each keep you under
            the limit can still put you over it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating a personal break as a scheduled break.</strong> Full-time work during
            breaks depends on the break being a scheduled one in the academic calendar, with study
            either side of it. A semester you sat out is not a scheduled break.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Continuing to work after enrolment changed.</strong> Dropping below full-time,
            taking leave, being withdrawn for academic reasons, or transferring institutions can end
            the permission. No letter arrives to say so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming the study-permit conditions carry you past graduation.</strong> The
            interval between finishing your programme and holding a post-graduation work permit is
            governed by its own rule, not by the conditions that let you work as a student. That rule
            can authorise work while a post-graduation application is pending, but only where a
            specific set of requirements is met — about the permit you held, when you apply, and
            whether you stayed within your student work conditions throughout. It is not automatic, and
            assuming it applies to you is a common and expensive error. Check your own position against{' '}

            not a technical breach at all. It is a student working the maximum permitted hours,
            failing terms, losing full-time enrolment, and losing both the work permission and the
            study permit that depended on it. The permit exists to let you study.

              We are asked regularly whether a student can cover tuition and living costs from
              permitted work in Canada. Realistically, no. Permitted student work is part-time during
              sessions, usually at entry-level wages, and Canadian tuition for international students
              plus rent in Toronto, Vancouver or Mississauga is not a part-time-wage problem. Students
              who arrive on that assumption tend to end up either in financial trouble or working
