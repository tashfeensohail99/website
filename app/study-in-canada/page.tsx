              <p>
                A study permit is permission to study in Canada at a designated learning institution.
                It is not a visa in itself — an approved applicant is normally also issued the travel
                document they need, and the permit itself is issued when you arrive.
              </p>
              <p>
                An officer is deciding two things. First, whether you meet the requirements: a real
                acceptance from a designated institution, an attestation letter where one is
                required, the money to pay for it, and admissibility on medical and security grounds.
                Second, and this is where most Pakistani applications fail, whether you are a genuine
                student who will leave at the end of the authorised stay.
              </p>
              <p>
                That second test is a judgement call, and it is made by a human being reading your
                file. It is why two applicants with identical bank statements get different answers.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            There is a real sequence here, and it is worth understanding properly rather than as a
            slogan. Study at a qualifying institution, graduate, obtain a post-graduation work
            permit if you are eligible, work in Canada, and then use that Canadian education and
            Canadian skilled work experience to apply under a federal express-entry stream or a
            provincial nominee programme. Both Canadian study and Canadian work experience carry
            genuine weight in how candidates are ranked and selected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now the parts the brochure leaves out. Every step in that chain is a separate
            application with its own eligibility rules, and every one of them can end the chain.
            Selection thresholds move. Provinces change their streams, and some of them close
            streams without much notice. Federal selection has shifted toward particular occupations
            and toward French, and those priorities are reset periodically. The rules that apply to
            you when you graduate are not necessarily the rules that applied when you enrolled, and
            nobody — including us — can tell you what they will be three years out.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the sane way to make this decision is this: choose a programme that is worth its cost
            to you as an education. If the immigration outcome arrives, it is a substantial bonus. If
            you would not spend the money on the course without the promise of PR attached, that is a
            signal to look at a different route rather than a reason to go ahead.
          </p>
          <p>
            We would rather tell you that on a consultation call than take a service fee for a plan
            we don’t think is sound.{' '}
