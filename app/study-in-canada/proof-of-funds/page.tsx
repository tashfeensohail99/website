    q: 'How much money do I have to show?',
    a: 'IRCC sets a minimum for living costs, separate from tuition and travel, and it is periodically updated. It also differs depending on how many family members are coming with you. We deliberately do not print the figure here, because a number that is right today would quietly mislead you next year. Read it on IRCC’s own study permit pages on the day you apply. And treat it as a floor, not a target: meeting the minimum exactly, with nothing behind it, is not a strong file.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I have to buy a GIC?',
    a: 'A guaranteed investment certificate is not the only acceptable evidence, and there are applicants for whom it is unnecessary. It is popular because it can answer all three tests at once — the money exists, it sits in a Canadian institution in your name, and these products typically release the funds to you in instalments after you arrive. The terms differ by institution, and the fast-track study stream that once made a GIC effectively compulsory for some applicants no longer exists, so check IRCC’s current study permit guidance rather than relying on what was true a couple of intakes ago.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My uncle is paying. Is that acceptable?',
    a: 'A sponsor who is not a parent is not automatically a problem, but it does raise the question of why. The file needs to make the relationship, the reason for the support and the sponsor’s own financial position all legible at once. A sponsor with a documented income, a clear stated relationship and a written commitment is far more persuasive than a closer relative with an unexplained balance.',
  },
  {
    q: 'A large amount was deposited recently. Will that be a problem?',
    a: 'It will be looked at. A large deposit shortly before applying is not fatal, but it is unexplained until you explain it. Show where it came from — a property sale with the deed and the transfer record, a matured investment with the statement, a gift with the giver’s own evidence. What sinks these files is not the deposit; it is the deposit with nothing attached to it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I show property, gold or land instead of cash?',
    a: 'Assets can support the picture of a family that genuinely has resources, but they do not on their own satisfy the availability test, because they would have to be sold or borrowed against before they could pay anyone. Treat them as context, not as the answer. Where an asset has been converted, show the conversion.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I use a borrowed balance just for the application?',
    a: 'No. Money parked in an account to produce a statement and withdrawn afterwards is misrepresentation, not a technical error. The consequence is not simply a refusal — a finding of misrepresentation can make you inadmissible to Canada for a fixed period set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, which is a far worse outcome than being told to wait and build a genuine position. Read the current consequences on IRCC’s own pages, and if you have already been accused of it, speak to a licensed representative rather than acting on anything you read online.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I was refused for insufficient funds. Can I just add more money and reapply?',
    a: 'Sometimes, but usually the refusal was about the origin or the availability of the money rather than its quantity, and adding more of the same kind of evidence changes nothing. Order the officer’s notes and read what was actually said before you reapply. See our pages on GCMS notes and on re-applying.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does showing strong funds mean I will be approved?',
    a: 'No. Funds are one part of the assessment. An officer is also weighing whether the programme makes sense given your history, and whether you will leave at the end of your authorised stay.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            You must satisfy an officer that you can pay your tuition, support yourself and any
            family members who come with you for the period of study, and cover the journey home.
            That obligation sits in Canada’s immigration regulations, and IRCC publishes a minimum
            figure for living costs that it revises from time to time.
          </p>
          <p>
            But meeting that figure is the beginning of the assessment, not the end of it. A file that
            hits the number and fails on origin can still be refused, and so can a file comfortably
            above the number with a balance that appeared from nowhere. Officers assess the evidence as
            a whole rather than checking a total, so a financial position that does not hang together
            invites questions the amount alone will not answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            So it helps to stop thinking of proof of funds as a threshold and start thinking of it as
            three separate tests, all of which have to pass.

              A frequent mistake is submitting a one-page letter from a bank confirming a
              closing balance, and nothing else. It proves the money existed on one day. It says
              nothing about where it came from, whether it stayed, or whether you can use it — which
              means it fails two of the three tests on its own.
            </p>
            <p>
              A statement showing the account’s movement over a run of months does far more work,
              because it lets the officer see the balance being built rather than simply asserted.

            <Prose>
              <p>
                Most Pakistani students are funded by family, and that is entirely normal. It is not
                treated with suspicion. What is treated with suspicion is a sponsor who appears in the
                file as a name and a signature and nothing more.
              </p>
              <p>
                The rule of thumb is simple: a sponsor has to be documented as thoroughly as the
                applicant would be. Their income, their holdings, their own history of that money, and
                a written statement of exactly what they are committing to. If the sponsor could not
                pass the three tests themselves, the sponsorship does not fix your file — it moves the
                weakness one step back.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where the sponsor’s income is informal — agricultural income, an unregistered business,
                remittances from relatives abroad — say so plainly and evidence it in whatever form
                genuinely exists. An honest explanation of irregular income is far stronger than
                paperwork constructed to look conventional.

          title="Why a sudden large deposit reads badly"
        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            An officer reading a statement is building a story about your household. Income arrives at
            intervals, expenses leave, and a balance accumulates in a way that is consistent with what
            you have said your family does. That coherence is the evidence. The closing figure is only
            the summary of it.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single large credit shortly before the application breaks that coherence. It might be
            entirely innocent — a property sale, a matured policy, a genuine gift from a relative
            abroad. But on the page it can look indistinguishable from money borrowed briefly to
            produce a statement, and the officer has only the document in front of them to go on.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fix is not to hide the deposit. It is to attach its origin to it: the sale deed and the
            transfer record, the maturity statement, the remitter’s own evidence and a letter
            explaining the gift. A large credit with a documented source is unremarkable. The same
            credit with nothing attached invites the officer to draw the least favourable conclusion
            available to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two related patterns cause the same damage. A balance that appears and then substantially
            disappears after the statement date suggests the funds were never yours. And funds spread
            thinly across many accounts, or moved between accounts in the weeks before applying,
            produce a picture that is difficult to follow — and an officer who cannot follow the money
            is not obliged to assume the best.

            <strong>Meeting the minimum exactly.</strong> Treating IRCC’s published living-cost figure
            as a target rather than a floor. A file that clears it by a margin, with tuition already

          <p>
            <strong>Forgetting everything except living costs.</strong> The living-cost figure sits
