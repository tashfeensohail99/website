Reading only the letter, most people guess wrong about which concern was decisive.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does "purpose of visit" mean on a study permit refusal?',
    a: 'It means the officer was not satisfied that the study itself makes sense as the reason for coming. Typically the concern is that the programme does not follow from your existing education or career, that it repeats a qualification you already hold, that it represents a step backwards, or that a comparable programme was available closer to home. It is a reasonableness assessment of the study plan, and it has no equivalent on a visitor visa file — which is why applicants who have been refused a visit visa before often do not recognise it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I just apply again with the same documents?',
    a: 'You can, and the answer is usually the same. A fresh application is assessed by a fresh officer on the file in front of them, but the previous application and its notes remain visible. If nothing in the new file addresses what the last officer found, there is no reason for a different outcome — and each refusal adds to a pattern that becomes harder to argue against later.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How soon can I re-apply?',
    a: 'IRCC’s general position is that you may apply again at any time unless your own decision letter says otherwise — read your letter, and check IRCC’s help centre for the current rule. The real constraint is whether you have anything new to say. Filing again a week later with the same evidence tends to buy a second refusal rather than an earlier start date.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a refusal count against my Express Entry or work permit applications later?',
    a: 'A refusal itself is not a bar and does not have to be hidden. It becomes a problem when it is not disclosed on later applications that ask about it, or when the reasoning behind it — for instance a finding about documents — was never dealt with. Disclose it accurately and address the underlying finding.',
  },
  {
    q: 'The officer doubted a document. Is that the same as any other refusal?',
    a: 'No. A concern about the genuineness of a document is a materially more serious matter than an unconvincing study plan, because a finding of misrepresentation carries a period of inadmissibility set by law. If your notes point in that direction, treat it as urgent, do not simply re-file, and get advice from a licensed representative — a Canadian immigration lawyer or an RCIC — before you respond to anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you tell me my chances of success on a second application?',
    a: 'No, and we would not put a figure on it. What we can do is read the officer’s notes with you and tell you honestly whether the finding is one that better evidence can answer — and, when it is not, say so before you spend money on a second attempt.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            A study permit refusal letter is a standard form. The officer works through a fixed list
            of headings and marks the ones under which they had concerns. The letter that reaches you
            is therefore a summary of categories — it is not a written decision in the sense a lawyer
            or a court would use the term.
          </p>
          <p>
            The decision itself lives in the officer’s entry in IRCC’s case management system. That
            entry is typically brief — often a few sentences — but it is where the officer sets out
            what they weighed and what they concluded. Two applicants can receive letters with
            identical boxes ticked and have entirely different underlying findings.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters because almost every decision you make next depends on which finding was
            decisive. Those notes are released through an access-to-information request rather than
            handed to you with the letter, and applicants outside Canada generally need a
            representative in Canada to file it — the eligibility rules and the current process are

            <Prose>
              <p>
                Underlying most study permit refusals is a single statutory question: is the officer
                satisfied that you will leave Canada at the end of the period authorised for your
                stay. That question also sits behind visitor visa refusals, and applicants who have
                been refused a visit visa often assume this is the same assessment.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is not. On a study permit the officer has an additional angle available to them —
                whether the course of study itself is a reasonable thing for you to be doing. If the
                programme does not follow from your qualifications, repeats something you already
                hold, is a step down from your existing level, or is available on comparable terms
                closer to home, the officer can conclude that study is not the real purpose of the
                trip.
              </p>
              <p>
                No amount of additional bank documentation answers that finding. It is answered, if it
                can be answered at all, by explaining the logic of the programme against your actual
                career — or by choosing a different programme.

              The most common reaction to a study permit refusal is to submit again immediately, with
              the same documents and a new fee. It is understandable — there is usually a term start
              date bearing down on you. It also rarely works.
            </p>
            <p>
              A new officer looks at the new file, but your previous application and the notes on it
              remain on the record. If nothing in the new submission engages with what the last
              officer found, there is no mechanism by which the outcome should change. Meanwhile each
              refusal becomes part of a pattern that later officers see, and that a reconsideration
              request or a court application becomes harder to argue against.
