    q: 'Do I need one if I am applying to extend a permit I already hold?',
    a: 'Not necessarily. Applicants extending from within Canada at the same institution and the same level of study have fallen outside the requirement — note that both conditions matter, so moving up a level, or moving school, is not the same case. Because the exception list is revised, confirm your own situation against IRCC’s current page rather than against advice from a previous intake.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many letters does my province issue and what is the cut-off?',
    a: 'Allocations are set centrally and distributed by each province or territory, and both the totals and the distribution rules are revised. We do not publish those figures, because a number that is right today misleads whoever reads this page next year. IRCC and the relevant provincial ministry publish the current position.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My institution says it has run out of attestation letters. What now?',
    a: 'That is a genuine constraint, not something to appeal. The realistic options are a later intake at the same institution, or a different institution or province with capacity. Before switching, check that the new programme still makes sense on its own terms — a hurried change of school is a common reason an application later reads as unconvincing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the attestation letter a guarantee my study permit will be approved?',
    a: 'No. It confirms you have been counted within a province or territory. It says nothing about your funds, your academic history, the logic of your study plan, or whether an officer is satisfied you will leave at the end of your authorised stay. Refusals after an attestation letter has been issued are ordinary.',
  },
  {
    q: 'The name on my letter does not match my passport. Does it matter?',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Canada limits how many study permit applications it will process, and distributes that
            capacity among the provinces and territories. Each province and territory then decides how
            its share is used across its own institutions. A provincial attestation letter — a
            territorial attestation letter, in the territories — is the document that records that you
            have been counted within that share.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is a short letter. It identifies you by name, date of birth and current residential
            address, and confirms that a place within the province or territory has been attributed to
            you. That is its entire function.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stated rationale, when the measure was introduced, was that international student
            numbers had grown faster than housing, health services and institutional capacity in
            several provinces. Whatever the reasoning, the effect is the same: the attestation letter
            puts a provincial hand on the volume before applications reach IRCC.
          </p>
          <p>
            What it is not: an approval, an assessment of you, or an opinion on your file. It is a
            capacity check, and nothing more.

              The letter is issued under provincial or territorial authority and handed to admitted
              students through their institution. There is no separate application an individual or a
              representative can file, and no fee that produces one outside that route.
            </p>
            <p>
              So an offer to supply a PAL for a price is either a charge for something that will arrive
              anyway once you accept an offer and pay tuition, or it is a fabricated document. A
              fabricated attestation letter is misrepresentation, and misrepresentation carries a bar
              on future applications that will outlast whatever course you were trying to start.

          <p>
            Two consequences follow from that order. First, the money leaves your hands before the
            immigration decision is made — you pay tuition to obtain the letter, and only then does
            IRCC look at your file. Understand the institution’s refund policy before you pay, because
            that policy, not your application, determines what you recover if the permit is refused.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, an incomplete application is not a slow application. Where the letter is required
            and absent, the file is not queued behind others — it is returned, and you begin again in a
            later cycle.

          <p>
            The requirement has never applied to everyone. Broadly, the exceptions fall into
            recognisable categories rather than a single rule:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Primary and secondary school students.</strong> Applicants for schooling below
              the post-secondary level have sat outside the requirement.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Certain graduate-level applicants.</strong> IRCC has narrowed the requirement for
              some master’s and doctoral applicants at public institutions. This is precisely the kind
              of exception that has been revised more than once — confirm it against the current
              official page before you rely on it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exchange students.</strong> Students studying under an exchange arrangement
              between their home institution and a Canadian designated learning institution, who do not
              pay tuition to the Canadian institution.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Holders of certain Government of Canada scholarships.</strong> Recipients of
              scholarships administered by Global Affairs Canada.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Some applicants already in Canada.</strong> Including people extending a permit
              at the same institution and the same level of study, and applicants covered by temporary
              public policies. Both conditions have mattered: changing school or moving up a level is
              treated differently from simply continuing.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Quebec is a separate route.</strong> If you are going to Quebec, the attestation
            function is carried by the Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) issued by the provincial
            ministry, which you apply for rather than receive automatically from your school — and
            the certificate has to carry the attestation wording for IRCC to accept it as such. Confirm
            the current position with the ministry and your institution before you file, and see our{' '}

          <p>
            If you believe an exception applies to you, you must show it. An application that arrives
            without an attestation letter and without evidence of the exception is treated the same way
            as one that simply forgot the letter.

          <p>
            <strong>Paying an agent for a letter.</strong> Either the agent charges you for something
            the institution would have issued anyway, or the document is fabricated. The second outcome
            is far worse than the wasted fee.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Filing before the letter exists.</strong> Applicants under time pressure submit and
            hope to supply the letter afterwards. Where it is required, the file is returned rather than
            held open.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Details that do not match.</strong> A name transliterated differently on the
            attestation letter than on the passport, or an old address, creates avoidable friction. Fix
            it with the institution before filing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating the letter as the hard part.</strong> It is not. The substantive risks in a

            <strong>Switching institutions to chase availability.</strong> Moving to whichever school
            still has capacity, in a programme unrelated to your background, reads badly to an officer
            assessing why you are going. Capacity is a real constraint, but it is a poor reason for a
            career change.

              We regularly speak to people who have organised their entire plan around obtaining an
              attestation letter, when the weaker part of their file is elsewhere: funds that cannot be

              The route also does not suit someone whose real objective is to work in Canada rather than
              to study. Tuition paid to obtain a letter is money spent on an education you did not want,
