The practical difference is which federal pathway carries you afterwards, and how the timelines behave.',

    q: 'Do I need a job offer from a Saskatchewan employer?',
    a: 'It depends entirely on the route. Some provincial routes are built around a named employer and cannot proceed without one.

  },
  {
    q: 'What does "intent to settle" actually mean in practice?',
    a: 'A province nominates you because it expects you to live and work there. It can and does assess whether your stated intention is credible — your ties to the province, why you chose it, whether your occupation exists in its economy, and what your plans look like. This is assessed at the provincial stage, and a thin or generic answer is a common reason a file struggles.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I take the nomination and then move to Toronto or Vancouver?',
    a: 'Mobility rights under the Charter apply once you are a permanent resident, so nobody is legally confined to a province after landing. But that is a different question from whether your stated intention was genuine when you applied. Applying to a province you never intended to live in, in order to obtain a nomination, is misrepresentation — and misrepresentation carries a bar on future applications. We will not build a file on that basis.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is Saskatchewan easier than Ontario or British Columbia?',
    a: 'That framing is how people lose money. Provinces select for their own labour markets, not on a shared difficulty scale, and a province that appears less competitive on paper is often more demanding about connection and genuine intent. The correct question is which province your occupation and history actually fit, not which one looks like a side door.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a nomination guarantee permanent residence?',
    a: 'No. A nomination is a provincial endorsement. Permanent residence is decided federally on admissibility, medicals, security, and the genuineness and completeness of the application. Nominations have been issued and permanent residence still refused. Anyone telling you a nomination settles the outcome is either mistaken or selling you something.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Every provincial nominee programme exists for one reason: the province has labour and
            settlement needs that federal selection alone does not meet, so Ottawa lets it nominate a
            share of newcomers itself. Understanding what a particular province wants tells you more
            about your chances than any stream description will.
          </p>
          <p>
            Saskatchewan is a resource and agriculture province. Its economy rests on grain and
            oilseed farming and the industries around it, on mining — potash and uranium above all,
            with newer critical-mineral activity — on oil and gas, on food and machinery
            manufacturing, and on the trades, transport and health services that keep all of that
            running. Its population is concentrated in Saskatoon and Regina, but a great deal of its
            labour demand sits in smaller cities and rural communities.
          </p>
          <p>
            That shape has consequences. The province tends to favour occupations its employers
            genuinely cannot fill locally, skilled trades and licensed professions among them, and it
            gives real weight to connection — people who have studied there, worked there, or have
            close family there. It is not primarily a destination for corporate head-office or
            large-scale tech careers, and an applicant whose occupation has no obvious place in that
            economy is unlikely to be selected regardless of how strong their profile looks in the
            abstract.
          </p>
          <p>
            Settlement is a stated priority in its own right. Saskatchewan has spent decades trying to
            attract and, more importantly, retain newcomers, particularly outside its two largest
            cities. Retention is the metric it cares about. Your file is read with that in mind.

            <p>
              Provincial streams are among the fastest-moving parts of Canadian immigration. They are
              paused mid-year, capped without warning, renamed, merged and replaced outright — an
              entire province’s stream framework can be closed and rebuilt from one intake to the
              next. Any page that prints a list of streams and their criteria can be quietly wrong,
              and people make expensive decisions on the strength of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we describe the categories, which are durable, and send you to the source for the
              specifics, which are not. That is also how we work in a consultation: we check what is
              open on the day, rather than repeating what was open last year.

                Saskatchewan has run parts of its skilled-worker selection through an expression of
                interest, and provinces move routes between the two mechanisms — check the province’s
                own page for the route you are considering rather than relying on this description.
                Where an expression of interest applies, you build a profile, it is scored against the province’s own grid, and it
                sits in a pool. Periodically the province draws from that pool and issues invitations
                to apply. A profile in a pool is not an application and gives you no status — a great
                many people misunderstand this and assume they are in the system when they are merely
                waiting to be looked at.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other routes — employer-supported and business routes in particular — are filed
                directly, without a pool. Which mechanism governs your case depends on the route, and
                the province states it on the page for that route.

                The scoring grid, the minimum needed to enter a pool, and the scores at which
                invitations are issued all move. We do not reproduce them here for the same reason we
                do not list streams.

                <strong>Enhanced nomination</strong> is aligned with the federal Express Entry system.

                profile; the nomination attaches to it and adds a substantial number of points to your
                federal ranking score. Permanent residence is then applied for through Express Entry.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Base nomination</strong> is not connected to Express Entry. The province
                nominates you, and you file a paper-based permanent residence application with IRCC
                directly. It is open to people who do not qualify for any Express Entry programme,
                which is precisely why base routes exist — but the federal processing that follows
                behaves differently from the Express Entry stream.

          <p>
            A province nominates because it expects to keep you. Every provincial programme therefore
            carries an expectation that you genuinely intend to live and work in that province, and
            the province assesses whether that intention is credible rather than simply asserted.
          </p>
          <p>
            What makes it credible is ordinary and specific: your occupation exists in that province’s
            economy; you have looked at where you would live and what you would do; you have family,
            study or work history there, or a concrete reason for choosing it. What makes it
            incredible is equally ordinary — a generic answer, an occupation with no local market, or
            an applicant who plainly picked the province off a list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you become a permanent resident, mobility rights under the Charter apply and nobody
            is legally confined to a province. That is a genuine legal fact and it is also how a
            particular kind of agent sells provincial nomination: apply anywhere, land, then move.
            Understand what that advice actually is. If your stated intention was false when you
            signed the application, that is misrepresentation, and the consequence is a bar on future
            applications — not a fine, not a delay, a bar. We do not build files on that basis, and we
            will tell you so plainly rather than take the fee.

          <p>
            <strong>Choosing the province that looks easiest.</strong> The single most expensive
            mistake on this page. Provinces select for their own labour markets; a province that seems
            less competitive is frequently stricter about connection and intent. Picking one you have
            no relationship with, because someone said the bar is lower there, tends to produce either
            a refusal or a genuineness problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating a pool profile as an application.</strong> An expression of interest is a
            scored entry in a queue. It grants nothing, guarantees nothing, and can sit indefinitely.
            People stop looking at other routes because they believe they are already in process.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Job offers that do not survive verification.</strong> Provinces contact employers.
            An offer arranged through an intermediary, from an employer who cannot explain the role or
            who is not operating as described, fails at that point — and takes your file with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Occupation coded to fit the route.</strong> Describing your work as something it
            was not, so that it matches an occupation the province wants, is a recurring source of
            misrepresentation findings. Your reference letters, payslips and duties have to match
            what you claimed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming a nomination ends the matter.</strong> It does not. The federal decision
            on admissibility, medicals, security and genuineness is separate, and it can go against
            you after a province has said yes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Applying on last year’s criteria.</strong> Files are still being prepared against
            requirements that changed months earlier, usually because the applicant is working from an
