const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'Which New Brunswick streams are open right now, and what are the criteria?',
    a: 'We deliberately do not list them here. Provincial streams open, pause and are replaced, and a list on a consultancy page is out of date faster than anyone updates it. The province publishes what is currently open, with the current criteria, on its own immigration site — that is the only list worth reading.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between an enhanced and a base nomination?',
    a: 'An enhanced nomination is issued to someone who already has a profile in the federal Express Entry system. Once the nomination is accepted in the profile, it adds a large fixed points award to the comprehensive ranking score — IRCC publishes the current figure. What that award does is make you competitive; it does not schedule you an invitation. IRCC runs separate rounds restricted to candidates who already hold a nomination, and it decides when to hold them, how many to invite and what the cut-off is. A base nomination is for candidates outside Express Entry, and leads to a permanent residence application processed outside that system. IRCC publishes current processing times for both. Which one you are eligible for depends on whether you meet the federal criteria for an Express Entry programme at all.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a job offer from a New Brunswick employer?',
    a: 'For most of the province’s capacity, in practice yes. Small provinces nominate mainly to fill identified vacancies, so employer-backed candidates dominate. There are usually some routes that do not require an offer, but they are narrower and more competitive than people assume.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get nominated by New Brunswick and then move to Toronto?',
    a: 'Nomination is granted on the basis that you intend to live and work in the province. You are asked to demonstrate that intent, and misrepresenting it is misrepresentation like any other — with the same consequences for future applications. Once you hold permanent residence your mobility rights are constitutional, but that is not a plan we will help you build, and provinces have become markedly more careful about assessing intent.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does French really matter?',
    a: 'In New Brunswick it matters more than in most provinces. It is Canada’s only officially bilingual province and francophone immigration is an explicit part of how it maintains that character. If you have functional French, get it tested — it can change which routes are realistically available to you, provincially and federally.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does a New Brunswick nomination take, and what does it cost?',
    a: 'The province publishes its current fees and service standards, and IRCC publishes the federal ones separately. Both change. We will not print figures here that you might rely on a year from now.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I pick New Brunswick because it looks easier than Ontario?',
    a: 'That reasoning has cost people a great deal of money. A province you have no connection to will read as a province you have no connection to, and the intent-to-settle assessment is where those files come apart. Pick a province because your occupation, your language and your realistic employment prospects point there.',

          <p>
            Every province nominates for its own reasons, and those reasons shape who gets selected far
            more than any published points table does. New Brunswick’s reasons are demographic before
            they are economic.

            It is one of Canada’s smaller provinces by population, and an older one — the current

            , and we would rather you read them there than take a number from us. Its economy is
            not concentrated in one metropolitan centre — it runs across several mid-sized cities and a
            great many small communities, with forestry, fisheries and seafood processing, food
            manufacturing, trucking and logistics, construction, and a growing information technology
            sector alongside the health care and education systems that every ageing population strains.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things follow from that. First, the province is looking for people who will fill
            identified vacancies, often outside the largest city, rather than for generalists with
            strong paper credentials. Second, it is looking for people who will still be there in ten
            years. Retention is the problem it is actually trying to solve, and it selects accordingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            New Brunswick is also Canada’s only officially bilingual province, home to a long-settled
            Acadian French-speaking community. Maintaining the francophone share of its population is a
            stated provincial priority, not a courtesy. If you speak French to a working standard, that
            is materially relevant here in a way it is not in most of the country.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            A provincial nomination is not permanent residence. It is a province telling the federal
            government that it wants you. The federal government still decides.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Enhanced nomination</strong> attaches to a profile already in the federal Express
            Entry system. Once accepted in the profile, it adds a large fixed award to your
            comprehensive ranking score — the current figure is published by{' '}
            <a
              href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system.html"

            </a>
            . Be clear about what that award does and does not do. It makes you competitive; it does not
            book you an invitation. Invitations to nominated candidates are issued through rounds that
            IRCC restricts to nominees, and IRCC alone decides when to hold one, how many candidates to
            invite and where the cut-off falls. It is also only available if you independently qualify
            for one of the federal Express Entry programmes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Base nomination</strong> is for candidates who are not in Express Entry. It leads to
            a permanent residence application processed outside that system, on its own timeline — IRCC
            publishes current processing times for each, and they move. For people whose age, language
            or education keeps them out of Express Entry, a
            base nomination is often the only realistic permanent residence route in existence — which
            is precisely why base streams attract far more applicants than they have capacity for.

              Provincial stream frameworks are rebuilt with little warning. Streams are renamed,
              restructured, paused mid-intake or withdrawn, and provinces are not obliged to give notice
              before doing it. A page that names streams and criteria is not merely stale when that
              happens; it is actively misleading, because it reads as current.

              <p>
                A province nominates because it wants a resident. That is the whole bargain. So the
                question of whether you genuinely intend to live in New Brunswick is not a formality at
                the end of the form — it is one of the things being assessed.
              </p>
              <p>
                What supports it is ordinary and concrete: a job offer from an employer there, family or
                a spouse’s family in the province, study or previous work there, a documented
                exploratory visit, professional licensing steps taken with the relevant New Brunswick
                regulator, a housing search that looks real. What undermines it is equally ordinary — a
                profile whose every connection points at Toronto or Vancouver, and a New Brunswick
                address that appeared the week the application did.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stating an intention you do not hold is misrepresentation. It carries a bar on future
                applications, and it is not a risk worth taking on a route you were treating as a
                shortcut in the first place.

            <strong>Applying to a stream that closed.</strong> People arrive with a printout from a
            website describing a stream that no longer exists, having already paid someone to prepare
            for it. Check the province’s live page first, every time.

            <strong>Province-shopping.</strong> Choosing New Brunswick because it looks less competitive
            than Ontario, with no occupation match, no employer and no French. This is the most common
            and most expensive mistake on this route.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A job offer that will not survive scrutiny.</strong> An offer bought from an agent,
            or from an employer who has never met you, fails on verification and takes the file with it.

          <p>
            <strong>Assuming a nomination is permanent residence.</strong> It is not. The federal
            decision on admissibility, medicals and honesty is separate, and a nomination does not carry
            you through it. A previous refusal in your history does not disappear because a province

              New Brunswick does not suit someone choosing it purely because it appears easier than a
              larger province. Nominating provinces expect genuine intent to settle, they assess it, and
              a profile with no employer, no family, no study history and no language fit there does not
              become stronger for being pointed at a smaller province.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also tends not to suit people whose occupation is urban and specialised in a way the
              provincial economy does not support, people who are unwilling to live outside a large
              metropolitan area, and people who need a fast answer — nomination adds a provincial stage
              before the federal one begins.
            </p>
            <p>
              And it does not suit anyone whose plan quietly depends on relocating elsewhere after
              landing. We will not build a file on that premise.
