A base nomination is for candidates who are not in Express Entry — the permanent residence application is filed as a paper-based provincial nominee application instead. Provinces run both, and the balance between them shifts. Which one is available to you depends on the stream and on whether you are Express Entry-eligible in the first place.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a nomination guarantee permanent residence?',
    a: 'No. A nomination is a provincial decision that carries real weight federally, but IRCC makes the permanent residence decision independently and assesses admissibility and the truthfulness of your file. Nominated applicants are sometimes refused. Anyone who tells you a nomination makes approval certain is selling something.',

  {
    q: 'Which Manitoba streams are open right now, and what are the cut-offs?',
    a: 'We deliberately do not publish stream lists, point cut-offs or draw scores here.

Manitoba publishes its open streams, its scoring grid and its draw results on its own site. Read them at the source, on the day.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I be nominated by Manitoba and then move to Toronto or Vancouver?',
    a: 'The nomination rests on a genuine intention to live and work in the nominating province. Provinces build their assessment around evidence of that intention, and misrepresenting it is misrepresentation like any other. Once you are a permanent resident, mobility rights apply — but the file you signed will have said you intended to settle in Manitoba, and a nomination obtained on a stated intention you never held is a serious problem, not a technicality.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I have no connection to Manitoba. Should I apply there because it looks easier?',
    a: 'This is one of the more expensive mistakes people make. Provinces that draw heavily on connection are precisely the provinces where a candidate with no tie scores poorly and waits indefinitely. Choosing a province by perceived ease, rather than by where you actually have family, an employer, study history or a realistic occupation, usually produces a profile that sits in a pool and is never drawn.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a job offer?',
    a: 'It depends entirely on the stream. Some provincial streams are built around an employer; others are not. What is consistent is that a job offer, where required, must be genuine and from an employer that can withstand verification — a purchased or arranged offer is fraud and carries a bar on future applications.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a nomination help my Express Entry score?',
    a: 'A provincial nomination attached to an Express Entry profile adds a large block of points under the Comprehensive Ranking System, which ranks a nominated candidate well above the general pool. IRCC publishes the current value on its own pages. Be careful with how this is described to you: a high ranking is not an automatic invitation. IRCC decides when rounds are held, which programme or category a round targets, and how many invitations it issues — so nobody can tell you which round you will be invited in, or that you will be invited at all. And this only applies to enhanced nominations, on a profile that is already Express Entry-eligible.',

    q: 'How long does a Manitoba nomination take?',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Every province nominates for its own reasons, and the reasons show up in who gets selected.
            Manitoba is a prairie province with a comparatively small population, one dominant urban
            centre in Winnipeg, and a set of rural and northern communities that struggle to hold on to
            working-age people. Its economy leans on agriculture and food processing, manufacturing —
            including aerospace, buses and agricultural equipment — transportation and logistics through
            Winnipeg’s rail and trucking corridors, mining in the north, and a large public health and
            education workforce.
          </p>
          <p>
            That produces a settlement priority as much as a labour one. Manitoba has run a nominee
            programme longer than most provinces and has consistently built it around retention: it
            would rather nominate someone with a reason to remain than a stronger candidate on paper who
            will leave for Toronto within a year. In practice that means demonstrable ties to the
            province — a close relative settled there, previous work or study in Manitoba, a Manitoba
            employer, or a business you are genuinely relocating — carry real weight in how the province
            selects.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you take one thing from this page, take that. The MPNP is not primarily a test of whether
            you are a good immigrant. It is a test of whether you are plausibly a{' '}

          title="How a provincial nomination actually works"

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Under Canada’s immigration framework, most provinces and territories run a nominee programme
            and can nominate people for permanent residence. Not every one of them does — Quebec selects
            economic immigrants under its own separate system rather than by nomination, and IRCC lists
            which provinces and territories currently participate. A nomination is a provincial decision that says the
            province wants you. It is not a visa, not permanent residence, and not a guarantee — the
            federal government still assesses admissibility and still makes the final decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nominations come in two forms. An <strong>enhanced</strong> nomination attaches to a live
            Express Entry profile, and the permanent residence application then runs through the Express
            Entry system; the nomination adds a very large block of points to the candidate’s ranking. A{' '}
            <strong>base</strong> nomination is for candidates outside Express Entry, and the permanent
            residence application is filed directly as a provincial nominee application. Provinces run
            both, and how they divide their capacity between the two changes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manitoba manages its intake through an expression-of-interest pool. You submit a profile, you
            are scored, and you sit in a ranked pool. The province draws from that pool and issues
            invitations — Manitoba’s term is a Letter of Advice to Apply. Only an invited candidate files
            a full application. This is why the honest answer to “when will I be selected” is that nobody
            knows: the province decides when it draws and how deep it goes.

          <p>
            <strong>Applying to a stream that no longer exists.</strong> The single most common problem.
            Someone read a blog, or an agent quoted a stream from two years ago, and the file is built
            around criteria that have since been replaced. Provincial programmes move faster than the
            content written about them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Province-shopping.</strong> Choosing Manitoba because a forum said the score
            threshold was lower, with no relative there, no employer, no study history and no intention
            to stay. Connection-weighted programmes are exactly where an unconnected candidate scores
            worst. The profile sits in the pool and is never drawn.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Points claimed but not evidenced.</strong> An expression of interest is self-declared.
            The full application is where every claim has to be documented. Points claimed for experience,
            language, relatives or education that cannot be evidenced to the province’s standard collapse
            at exactly the wrong moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A relative who does not count as one.</strong> Relationship categories are defined
            precisely and the definitions differ by province and by stream. A cousin, a family friend or
            a relative who is not settled in the province in the way the programme requires may carry no
            weight at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A purchased job offer.</strong> Where a stream requires an employer, that employer is
            verifiable and gets verified. An arranged offer from a business that cannot withstand scrutiny
            ends the file and, if it amounts to misrepresentation, bars you from applying again for a
            period set in law.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating the nomination as the finish line.</strong> The federal application is a real
            assessment with its own refusal grounds. Medical inadmissibility, an undeclared prior refusal,
            or an inconsistency between what you told the province and what you told IRCC will end a
            nominated file.

              A nominating province is choosing residents. It expects a genuine intention to live and
              work there, and it builds its assessment around evidence of that intention. If you have
              never been to Manitoba, have no family there, no employer, no study history and no
              intention of remaining once you land, you are not the candidate the programme is designed

              It also tends not to suit people whose occupation is not connected to what the province’s
