The province publishes what is open, and its own criteria, on its official immigration site at liveinnovascotia.com — read it there on the day you need it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is a Nova Scotia nomination easier to get than one from a larger province?',
    a: 'That framing is the mistake. Each province nominates against its own labour market and its own allocation, and a smaller province does not mean a lower bar — it often means fewer nominations available and a narrower set of occupations that qualify. Choosing a province because it looks less competitive, rather than because you would actually live and work there, is one of the more expensive errors we see.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I have to actually live in Nova Scotia after landing?',
    a: 'A province nominates on the understanding that you intend to settle there. Once you are a permanent resident, mobility rights under Canadian law are a matter of federal status rather than provincial control — but that is not a loophole to plan around. Evidence that you never intended to settle in the province goes to the honesty of your application, and misrepresentation carries consequences that outlast any nomination.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between an Express Entry-aligned nomination and a base one?',
    a: 'An Express Entry-aligned (enhanced) nomination requires you to already meet the criteria for one of the federal Express Entry programmes and to have a profile in that pool; the nomination then attaches to it and you apply federally through Express Entry. A base nomination sits outside Express Entry — you apply to IRCC through its separate non-Express Entry provincial nominee route instead, which has its own forms, document checklist and processing track. The evidentiary work is similar; the federal pathway afterwards is not. IRCC publishes the current requirements and submission method for both routes on canada.ca.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a job offer from a Nova Scotia employer?',
    a: 'It depends entirely on the stream, and that is precisely what shifts. Employer-driven categories obviously need one. Occupation-driven and Express Entry-aligned categories may not. Rather than guessing, check what is open and what it requires before you start collecting documents.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How is this different from the Atlantic Immigration Program?',
    a: 'The Atlantic Immigration Program is a separate federal route running across the four Atlantic provinces, built around designated employers rather than provincial nomination. If you are looking at Nova Scotia, both are worth understanding, because a candidate who does not fit one sometimes fits the other.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee me a Nova Scotia nomination?',
    a: 'No. Two governments make two separate decisions here and neither is ours. Anyone quoting you odds, a draw score, or a timeline for a provincial nomination is inventing them.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Nova Scotia is a small Atlantic province with one substantial urban centre, Halifax, and
            a large rural and coastal remainder. Its economy leans on the ocean — fisheries and
            seafood processing, shipbuilding, ports and marine logistics — alongside healthcare,
            universities, agriculture and food production, tourism, natural resources, and a
            growing professional and technology sector concentrated around Halifax.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two facts about the province shape its immigration policy more than anything else. Its
            population skews older than the Canadian average, which puts sustained pressure on
            healthcare and on the trades. And historically it has struggled with out-migration:
            people arrive, and then leave for larger provinces. So Nova Scotia does not simply want
            arrivals. It wants people who will still be there years later.
          </p>
          <p>
            That single priority explains most of how the programme behaves. It explains why
            connections to the province matter — a job offer from a Nova Scotia employer, study at a
            Nova Scotian institution, family already settled there, prior work in the province. It
            explains why occupations tied to the province’s actual gaps are favoured over generally
            impressive résumés. And it explains why an application that reads as though the province
            is a convenient entry point rather than a destination tends not to succeed.

                Provincial nomination is a shared jurisdiction. Under agreements with the federal
                government, provinces may nominate a limited number of candidates each year for
                permanent residence, against an allocation set federally. The province decides who to
                nominate. Only IRCC decides who becomes a permanent resident.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nova Scotia nominates through two structurally different mechanisms, and the

            <p>
              Provincial streams are among the fastest-moving parts of Canadian immigration. Nova
              Scotia has consolidated its nominee streams outright, and other provinces have
              replaced their stream frameworks wholesale. Criteria, eligible occupations and even
              stream names change between the day a page is written and the day it is read.
            </p>
            <p>
              A page that lists streams is therefore worse than a page that does not, because it
              gives a reader confidence in something that may already be wrong. What is open today,
              and on what terms, lives on the province’s own site — and nowhere else is authoritative.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>Province-shopping.</strong> Picking whichever province currently looks least
            competitive, with no connection to it and no intention of living there. Provinces assess
            intent to settle, and a file with no plausible link to Nova Scotia reads exactly as what
            it is. This is the single most common and most expensive error on this route.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Preparing against criteria that have changed.</strong> Applicants spend months
            and money assembling documents for a stream that has since been narrowed, paused or
            replaced. Confirm what is open before you begin, not after.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating an expression of interest as an application.</strong> A profile in a
            pool is a signal, not a claim. It creates no queue position you can rely on and no
            entitlement to be drawn.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A job offer that will not withstand scrutiny.</strong> Employer-driven
            nominations turn on whether the employer, the vacancy and the terms are genuine. An offer
            arranged as paperwork rather than as real employment is liable to be refused, and paying
            for one can put your admissibility at risk as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming nomination equals permanent residence.</strong> IRCC assesses
            admissibility, medicals, security and the truthfulness of the file independently. A
            nomination does not insulate an application from any of that.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Documents you did not write.</strong> Experience letters or offer letters
            produced by a third party, containing claims you cannot support, are misrepresentation
            whether or not you drafted them. The consequence lands on you and outlasts the file.

              A nominating province is choosing you on the expectation that you will settle there,
              work there and stay. If your real plan is Toronto, Calgary or Vancouver, and Nova
              Scotia is a means of entry, this is the wrong route — and it is not a clever one. It
              wastes time and money, it puts a settlement question into your file that you cannot answer
              honestly, and it is entirely avoidable.

            <p>
              This route also tends not to suit people whose occupation is not among the province’s
              actual gaps, however strong their credentials; people with no connection at all to the
              province and no employer interest in them; and anyone who needs a decision on a fixed
