The province publishes what is open, and the criteria attached to it, on WelcomeBC. That is the only reliable source, and it should be read on the day you act on it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between a base nomination and an Express Entry-aligned one?',
    a: 'An Express Entry-aligned (sometimes called enhanced) nomination requires you to already be eligible for and in the federal Express Entry pool. The nomination adds points to your federal ranking score and you then apply to IRCC through Express Entry. A base nomination does not require Express Entry eligibility; you apply to IRCC through the ordinary provincial nominee route instead. The provincial requirements differ, and so does how the federal side is processed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a nomination guarantee permanent residence?',
    a: 'No. A nomination is a provincial recommendation. IRCC makes the permanent residence decision independently and assesses admissibility, security, medical grounds and the honesty of what you have submitted. A nomination can be held and permanent residence still refused.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a job offer in British Columbia?',
    a: 'It depends on the category, and the categories change. As a general matter, a genuine offer from a B.C. employer strengthens most provincial applications considerably and is a hard requirement for some. Categories that require no offer exist in various provinces at various times, but they are usually narrow and competitive.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get nominated by B.C. and then move to Ontario or Alberta?',
    a: 'You should not plan on it. Provincial nomination exists because a province wants the person to settle there, and provinces assess whether your intent to live in the province is genuine. Nominating on an intent you do not hold is a misrepresentation risk, and misrepresentation carries a bar on future applications. If you intend to live elsewhere, apply through a route that matches that intention.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is British Columbia easier than other provinces?',
    a: 'No province is reliably "easier". Provinces adjust their selection as demand and their federal allocation change, so a province that looks accessible in one year can be substantially harder the next. Choosing a province by perceived ease rather than by where you actually have work, family or a credible plan is one of the more expensive mistakes we see.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you tell me my chances of being invited?',
    a: 'No, and be careful of anyone who does. Selection depends on who else registers, on the province’s priorities at the time and on an allocation the province does not control. We can tell you whether your profile is realistically competitive for a category and what would need to change — not what a future draw will do.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Every provincial nominee programme exists for one reason: a province has economic gaps
            it cannot fill from its own population, and immigration is the instrument it uses to
            fill them. Provincial selection is therefore narrower and more purposeful than federal
            selection. Express Entry asks whether you are likely to succeed anywhere in Canada. A
            province asks whether you are likely to fill a specific need there, and stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            British Columbia’s economy is concentrated on the Pacific coast and shaped by it: ports
            and trade, resource industries and forestry, a substantial technology and film sector
            around Vancouver, tourism, and — as in every province — health care, skilled trades and
            care work that cannot be staffed locally. The province is also unusually lopsided
            demographically. A large share of the population sits in Metro Vancouver, while smaller
            interior, northern and island communities carry serious labour shortages and an ageing
            population.
          </p>
          <p>
            That lopsidedness shapes provincial policy. Provinces in this position generally try to
            direct nomination towards regions outside the largest metro area, and to occupations
            that keep public services and construction running. If your plan is to arrive in
            Vancouver because it is the city you have heard of, understand that you are aiming at
            the most contested part of the province’s intake.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is also a cost dimension worth saying plainly. Housing in and around Vancouver is
            among the most expensive in Canada. A wage that reads well from Lahore can be tight
            there once rent is paid. That is a settlement question, not an immigration question, but
            it is the one people underestimate most.

                A provincial nomination can reach IRCC by two different roads, and the choice is not
                cosmetic — it changes what you must qualify for and how the federal stage runs.

                An <strong>Express Entry-aligned</strong> nomination (the province’s enhanced option)
                requires you to be eligible for, and in, the federal Express Entry pool in your own
                right. A provincial nomination adds points to your Comprehensive Ranking System
                score. How many, and what that means in practice, is set by IRCC and published on
                its{' '}

                . A nominated candidate ranks materially higher than they otherwise would, but an
                invitation to apply still depends on how IRCC runs its rounds — which is a federal
                decision, not a provincial one, and not something anyone can promise you in advance.
              </p>
              <p>
                A <strong>base</strong> nomination does not require Express Entry eligibility. You
                apply to IRCC through the ordinary provincial nominee route instead. It is the route
                for people whose profile does not meet a federal economic programme’s own criteria,
                and it is generally processed on a different and slower footing.

          <p>
            A province nominates you because it expects you to live there. That expectation is not
            decorative. Provinces assess whether your stated intention is credible, and they look at
            the same things anyone would: whether you have worked, studied or lived there, whether
            you have family or an employer there, whether you can support yourself while you settle,
            and whether your plan for the first year makes sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you hold permanent residence, mobility rights under the Charter apply and no
            province can police where you live. That fact is widely repeated in agent marketing as
            though it were a strategy. It is not. Signing a declaration of intent you do not hold is
            a misrepresentation — an untrue statement made to obtain a benefit — and misrepresentation
            findings carry a bar on applying to Canada again. The risk is not that someone tracks
            your address after landing. The risk is what happens at the file.
          </p>
          <p>
            The practical version of this is simpler than the legal one. Pick the province where you
            actually have something — an employer, a qualification, family, an occupation the place
            genuinely needs. A file built on a real connection is stronger at every stage than one
            built on a guess about which province is easiest this year.

            <p>
              Provincial nomination is not a shortcut around federal selection. It suits people with
              a specific reason to be in a specific place. If you have never been to British
              Columbia, have no employer there, no qualification from there and no family there, and
              you are considering it purely because it appeared in a list of options, you are in the
              weakest possible position — and you are competing against people with all of those
              things.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also tends not to suit people whose occupation is well supplied in the province, and
              people whose budget assumes a Metro Vancouver wage will stretch the way it would in a
              cheaper Canadian city. Entrepreneur routes are their own discipline and are not a
              softer alternative to the skilled-worker ones — they involve capital at risk, a
              performance agreement, and a work permit period before any nomination.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your profile is genuinely strong on its own, a federal route may be the more direct
              conversation. If it is not, a province where you actually have a connection is a better
