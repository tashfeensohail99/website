  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between enhanced and base nomination?',
    a: 'An enhanced nomination is aligned with Express Entry: you must already have an eligible Express Entry profile, and the nomination attaches to it. A base nomination sits outside Express Entry — you are nominated by the province and then file a paper-based permanent residence application to IRCC through a different route. The evidence the province wants is broadly similar; the federal path afterwards is not.',

  {
    q: 'Which Ontario streams are open right now, and what are the criteria?',
    a: 'We deliberately do not list them. Ontario has restructured its nomination framework before — most recently in 2026, when its existing streams were replaced — and provincial streams open, close, pause and are replaced without much notice. Any page naming streams and their criteria is a page that will mislead somebody. Ontario publishes what is open on its own programme pages — read it there, on the day.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a job offer to be nominated by Ontario?',
    a: 'It depends entirely on the route. Employer-driven routes are built around one; graduate, occupation-targeted and francophone routes may not require one. What is constant is that a job offer used in a provincial application has to be real, verifiable and from an employer who will withstand the province’s scrutiny.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get nominated by Ontario and then move to another province?',
    a: 'Legally, permanent residents have mobility rights once status is granted. But you are asked at application stage whether you intend to live in the nominating province, and answering yes when you do not is misrepresentation. Provinces track retention and assess intent seriously. Treat the question as meaning what it says.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My occupation is not on any in-demand list. Is that fatal?',
    a: 'For occupation-targeted routes, usually yes for now — those lists exist precisely to exclude. It does not necessarily end provincial nomination generally, and it says nothing about federal Express Entry, where the criteria are different. The honest first question is whether a provincial route is the right one for you at all.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is Ontario easier than other provinces?',
    a: 'No province is reliably easier, and chasing the one that looks easiest this quarter is how people end up filing weak applications in provinces they have no connection to. Ontario has a large economy and a correspondingly large pool of interested applicants, which cuts both ways — the province is also working within a nomination allocation it does not set itself. Every province publishes its own current criteria; that is the only basis on which to compare them.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much does it cost and how long does it take?',

          <p>
            Immigration in Canada is shared between the federal government and the provinces. Under
            that arrangement, provinces are allocated a number of nominations each year and may
            recommend candidates who meet their own economic needs. Ontario’s programme for doing
            this is the Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program, usually shortened to OINP.
          </p>
          <p>
            A nomination is a recommendation, not a decision. Ontario tells IRCC that it wants you;
            IRCC then makes the permanent residence decision on its own terms, assessing
            admissibility, security, medical requirements and the truthfulness of what you have
            filed. Two governments, two decisions, in that order.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters practically. It means a nomination cannot be treated as an outcome, and it
            means a problem in your federal file — an old refusal, an undisclosed history, a
            document you did not write — is not cured by provincial support.

            Ontario has the largest provincial economy in Canada and takes in a large share of new
            permanent residents each year — IRCC publishes the{' '}

            if you want the current numbers. Its labour market is unusually broad: financial and
            professional services concentrated in the Greater Toronto Area, a large public health
            care system across the whole province, advanced manufacturing and automotive work in the
            southwest, agriculture and food processing in the rural south, and a technology sector
            spread across several cities rather than one.
          </p>
          <p>
            That breadth shapes what the province wants. Ontario is not short of applicants — it is
            short of specific workers in specific places. Persistent shortages sit in health care,
            in the skilled trades and construction, and in occupations that are hard to fill outside
            the largest urban centres. Nomination is the instrument the province uses to address
            those gaps, which is why occupation and location carry weight that a purely federal
            application does not give them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ontario also has a settlement concern, not only a hiring one. Provinces are measured on
            whether the people they nominate stay. Evidence that you are connected to the province —
            you have worked there, studied there, have family there, hold a genuine offer there —
            is not a bonus. For many routes it is the substance of the case.

                Provincial nomination attaches to the federal system in one of two ways, and the
                difference decides what your file looks like.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Enhanced</strong> nomination is aligned with Express Entry. You must already
                have an eligible Express Entry profile before the province can nominate you. The
                nomination attaches to that profile and you continue through the electronic Express
                Entry process.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Base</strong> nomination sits outside Express Entry. The province nominates
                you directly, and you then file a separate permanent residence application to IRCC
                through the non-Express-Entry route. This matters for people who cannot meet Express
                Entry’s own entry requirements — base routes are the reason provincial nomination is
                sometimes available to candidates federal programmes will not take.

              Provincial streams open, pause, close on volume, and are replaced outright. Ontario
              rebuilt its nomination framework in 2026, replacing the streams it had been running —
              routes that had been described on hundreds of advisory pages ceased to exist, and
              those pages did not update. People prepared applications for streams that were no

            <strong>Preparing for a stream that no longer exists.</strong> The most expensive mistake
            on this route, and it has nothing to do with your qualifications. People work from an
            agent’s summary or a year-old article, assemble documents for criteria that were
            replaced, and discover it at the point of filing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Choosing a province with no connection to you.</strong> Applicants pick whichever
            province is described as easiest that season. The province then assesses intent to settle
            and finds nothing — no work history there, no study, no family, no offer. It reads exactly
            as what it is.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating registration as application.</strong> An expression of interest is not a
            filed application and does not accrue seniority. Waiting in a pool while a direct-application
            window opens and closes elsewhere is a real and recurring loss.

            An offer arranged through a third party, from a business that is dormant or cannot explain
            the role, fails at the province and can contaminate your federal file as misrepresentation.

              Nominating provinces expect you to live there. Choosing a province you have no link to
              because it appears to have lower requirements this quarter is one of the most common and
              most expensive mistakes we see. The application asks you to demonstrate intent to settle;
              with nothing to demonstrate, you are paying a provincial fee to have that gap noticed.
              Answering the intent question untruthfully is worse — that is misrepresentation, and it
              carries a bar on future applications.

              This route also tends not to suit people whose occupation is well supplied in Ontario, or
              who have no Ontario employer, study or work history and no realistic way to acquire one.
