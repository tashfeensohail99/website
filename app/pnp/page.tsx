        streams frequently, and a province can rebuild its whole framework at once. A page listing

            <p>
              Canada’s provinces and territories each hold an agreement with the federal government
              that lets them nominate a set number of economic immigrants a year, chosen against
              their own priorities. A province that needs healthcare workers builds streams around
              healthcare workers. A province losing population from its rural towns builds streams
              that require you to settle in one.
            </p>
            <p>
              What a province cannot do is admit you to Canada. Nomination is a recommendation with
              real weight — but immigration admissibility is federal, and IRCC assesses it
              independently at the second stage. You need both to succeed. Either one can end it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quebec sits outside this entirely, selecting under its own agreement, and one
              territory does not operate a nominee programme at all. Everywhere else, the two-stage
              shape above holds.

              <p>
                A base stream does not touch Express Entry. You do not need a profile, and for many
                people that is the entire point — base streams are how someone who cannot meet
                Express Entry’s own criteria still reaches permanent residence.

              <p>
                After nomination you file a paper-based permanent-residence application directly with
                IRCC. It is a different, slower queue, and it does not benefit from Express Entry’s
                service standards.
              </p>
              <p>
                Base is not a lesser outcome. The permanent residence at the end is identical. What
                differs is how long you live with the uncertainty.

              If you can qualify for Express Entry independently, an enhanced stream is almost always

              If you cannot, chasing enhanced streams is chasing a door that will not open for you,
              and the honest answer is to build a base-stream case and plan for the longer timeline.
              Working that out correctly at the start is worth more than anything that happens later.

                Every province nominates on the understanding that you intend to live and work
                there. They ask you to demonstrate it — through ties, a job, study history, family,
                a settlement plan, or a business you are genuinely establishing in that province.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some applicants treat a smaller province as a back door: nominate there, land, then
                move to Toronto or Vancouver. Understand what that is. Once you hold permanent
                residence, Canada’s mobility rights mean you cannot be physically held in one
                province. But stating an intention you never held is misrepresentation at the point
                of application.
              </p>
              <p>
                The consequence of misrepresentation is not a refusal you can refile after. It is a
                finding that follows you and bars further applications for years. We will not build a

                You are waiting for someone to name a province where you will definitely be selected.
                Nobody can. Streams open, close and change criteria, and provinces select against
                their needs, not your preference.

              Provincial streams change constantly. They pause when allocations run low, reopen on
              short notice, get retired entirely, and occasionally a province rebuilds its whole
              framework at once. Criteria move with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              So a page listing “streams currently open” is a page that is quietly wrong most of the
              time — and the harm is not abstract. Someone reads a stale list, builds a plan around a
              stream that closed two quarters ago, and loses months. We would rather this page stay
              true.

              Current openings, criteria and government charges live on each province’s own website
              and on IRCC’s. Those are the only sources worth relying on for a live figure, and they
              are where we check when we assess your file — not against a page we wrote once. Start
