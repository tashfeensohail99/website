  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between an enhanced and a base nomination?',
    a: 'An enhanced nomination is issued through a stream aligned with the federal Express Entry system, to a candidate who has a profile in the Express Entry pool — the nomination then operates within that system. A base nomination is issued outside Express Entry, and permanent residence is applied for through the separate non-Express-Entry provincial nominee route. The provincial assessment is similar in kind; what differs is the federal process that follows. IRCC publishes current processing information for each route on its own site.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is an expression of interest an application?',
    a: 'No. It is a profile registered in a pool so the province can consider you in its selection rounds. It creates no status, no entitlement and no queue position you can rely on. Many people register and are never invited.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a job offer in PEI?',
    a: 'For most provincial nomination routes in most provinces, an offer from a local employer is either required or heavily weighted, and PEI’s selection has long leaned on employer connection. Some routes are structured differently. Which of those applies to you is exactly the thing to check on the province’s current programme page rather than assume.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get nominated by PEI and then move to Toronto?',
    a: 'A nomination is granted on the basis that you intend to live and work in that province. Signalling otherwise undermines the application, and if the province concludes the stated intent was not genuine, that is a serious problem — potentially a misrepresentation one, which carries a bar on future applications. Choose a province you actually intend to live in.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is PEI easier to get into than a larger province?',
    a: 'That framing is the mistake. PEI is small, so its nomination capacity is small and its labour market is narrow — an occupation with few employers on the Island is harder to place there than in a large province, not easier. "Easier" is not a property a province has; fit is.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee me a provincial nomination?',
    a: 'No, and nobody honestly can. Selection from the pool is the province’s decision and permanent residence is IRCC’s. Neither is ours to make. We publish a no-guarantee policy for that reason.',

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Most Canadian provinces and territories hold an agreement with the federal government
            allowing them to nominate a limited number of economic immigrants each year — people the
            province judges able to establish themselves there and intending to stay. Quebec is
            outside this system and selects its own economic immigrants under a separate agreement,
            and not every territory runs a nominee programme. Prince Edward Island’s programme is
            administered by its Office of Immigration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two decisions follow one another. The province decides whether to nominate you. IRCC
            then decides, separately, whether to grant permanent residence — assessing admissibility,
            health, security and the truthfulness of what you have filed. A nomination is a strong
            step, and it is not the end of the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Provincial allocations are finite. They are set with the federal government, they are
            revised from year to year, and in a province this small the absolute number of
            nominations available is not large. IRCC and the province publish the current position;
            we do not reproduce the figures here because they move. That constraint shapes
            everything about how PEI selects: it can afford to be specific
            about occupation, employer and intent in a way a large province cannot.

            <p>
              This is the single most expensive mistake in provincial nomination, and it is made
              constantly. People choose a province because it looks like a shorter queue, not because
              they intend to live there. Nominating provinces are explicitly selecting for people who
              will settle and stay, and they assess intent as a live question — connections, plans,
              why this province and not another. A file with no answer to that question is weak from
              the start, and stating an intent you do not hold is misrepresentation, which carries a
              bar on future applications rather than just a refusal.
            </p>
            <p>
              PEI in particular tends not to suit people whose occupation has almost no employer base
              on the Island, people with no employer connection and no study or work history there,
              and people who need a large urban labour market, a specific professional regulator or a
              particular community to build a life around. None of that is a criticism of the Island
              — it is a small province and it does not pretend to be a large one.
