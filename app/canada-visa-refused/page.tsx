/**
 * The refusal hub — for people who have just been refused and need a real path forward.
 *
 * These readers just had bad news and are frightened; several will have already
 * been burned by an agent promising a fix. Calm and useful outperforms urgent and
 * salesy here, and it is also simply the honest register for the subject.
 *
 * ⚠️ LEGAL REVIEW REQUIRED BEFORE PUBLISH: every statement about deadlines, what
 * the Federal Court can and cannot do, and misrepresentation consequences must be
 * signed off by a lawyer on the firm's team. These are drafted from general
 * knowledge of IRPA, not from the firm's practice. A reader who trusts a wrong
 * deadline here loses their only remedy.

    q: 'Does a refusal go on my record and hurt future applications?',
    a: (
      <>
        A refusal is part of your history, and future officers can see it. Reapplying blind and being
        refused again makes the next attempt harder, not easier — which is exactly why reading your
        GCMS notes before you do anything matters so much.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get my GCMS notes myself?',
    a: (
      <>
        Yes. Anyone can request them for a small fee paid to the Canadian government. The one part
        most applicants can’t do alone is that a Canadian citizen or permanent resident has to file
        the request on your behalf. We’d genuinely rather you read your notes than pay us for a
        strategy built on a guess.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'If I win at the Federal Court, do I get my visa?',
    a: (
      <>
        No. A judge does not re-decide your application. If you win, your file is sent back to be
        decided again by a <em>different</em> officer — who can, lawfully, refuse you a second time.
        Judicial review is a remedy for a decision made <em>improperly</em>, not a way to appeal
        until you get a yes.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I just reapply?',
    a: (
      <>
        For most people, yes — if the notes show a fixable evidence problem, reapplying is usually
        faster, cheaper and more likely to work than court. But that only holds if you’ve read the
        notes first. We’ll tell you honestly which of the three options is genuinely yours.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Can an agent handle my Federal Court case?',
    a: (
      <>
        No. Judicial review is a proceeding in the Federal Court of Canada — a consultant cannot file
        it and cannot appear. An agent who offers to “handle your court case” is telling you something
        important about themselves.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'How long do I have to go to the Federal Court?',
    a: (
      <>
        There is a strict deadline that runs from the day you receive the decision, and it is short —
        and different depending on whether the decision was made inside or outside Canada. If your
        refusal is recent, talk to someone this week, even if that someone isn’t us.
