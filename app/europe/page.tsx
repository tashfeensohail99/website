        Not any more. The law changed on 19 May 2026, and for Pakistani nationals naturalisation now
        takes ten years — counted from the day your first residence permit is issued. It applies the
        same way to the D7 and the Golden Visa. If someone is still quoting you five years today, you
        have learned something useful about them.
      </>
    ),

  {
    q: 'An agent is selling me a Maltese or EU “investment passport”. Is it legitimate?',
    a: (
      <>
        No. Malta’s citizenship-by-investment scheme was ruled unlawful by the EU’s highest court in
        April 2025 — it was the last one in the European Union. There is no lawful EU
        passport-for-cash route left. Anyone still selling one is selling you a problem.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Is a Caribbean passport a safe way to get visa-free access to Europe?',
    a: (
      <>
        It is on a clock. In June 2026 the European Commission wrote to all five Caribbean
        programmes demanding they phase the schemes out by 1 June 2028. Nobody can tell you exactly
        how that ends — but the EU already did exactly this to Vanuatu in 2024, permanently. If you
        are weighing six figures on a passport for European access, that timeline belongs in your
        decision, not in a footnote after you’ve paid.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Which Schengen consulate is the easiest to get a visa from?',
    a: (
      <>
        That is the wrong question, and asking it can get you refused. You are required to apply to
        your main destination — the country where you will spend the most time. Choosing the
        “easy” consulate instead is itself a refusal risk, not a shortcut.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee my Schengen visa?',
    a: (
      <>
        No — and neither can anyone else. A Schengen visa is decided by a visa officer, and no
        consultant can overrule that officer. What we can do is tell you honestly whether your case
        is strong, fix what is weak before it is filed, and tell you if we don’t think you’ll
        succeed — before you have paid us anything.
