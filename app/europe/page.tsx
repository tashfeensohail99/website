            It applies the same way to the D7 and to the Golden Visa. Only applications already filed

          Nobody can tell you exactly how that ends. But you already know the EU follows through —
          because it did it to Vanuatu in 2024, permanently, to everyone holding that passport. If
          you are considering six figures on a Caribbean passport for European access, that timeline
          belongs in your decision, not in a footnote after you’ve paid.

        <p className="mt-3 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          The most common thing people actually need, and heavily refused for Pakistani applicants.
          One thing worth knowing before you start: you are supposed to apply to your{' '}
          <em>main destination</em>, not to whichever country is rumoured to be easiest. Picking the
          “easy” consulate is itself a refusal risk.

        <p className="mt-3 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          Still a genuine route to living in Europe. Just not a five-year one. If a ten-year path
          works for your family, we will tell you honestly what it costs and how long it takes.

        <h3 className="mt-6 text-lg font-semibold">If you were refused</h3>
        <p className="mt-3 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          A Schengen refusal has its own appeal route and its own deadlines, and they differ by
          country. Send us the letter.
