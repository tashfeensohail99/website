  what the client contracts to pay the firm. If it already includes government

  "government fees" column double-counts and misleads. The whole point of this

              We used to charge PKR 5,000 for it. The reasoning was sound — a firm that earns nothing
              until you sign has every reason to tell you that you qualify — but it also put a price
              on the question itself. So the fee is gone, and what replaces it is written down
              instead of paid for: a summary of where you stand, before money is discussed.

              Notice the spread on the visit visa: the cheapest case cost less than half the most
              expensive. That is not inconsistency — it is the difference between one straightforward
              applicant and a family with a refusal history. Anyone quoting you a single fixed number
              before looking at your file is quoting the wrong number.
