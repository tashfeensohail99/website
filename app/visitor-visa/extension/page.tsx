    q: 'What is a visitor record, exactly?',
    a: 'A document issued inside Canada that states the date by which you must leave, and any conditions attached to your stay. It is proof of status while you are here.

    q: 'What does maintained status mean?',
    a: 'If you apply to extend before your current status expires and then stay in Canada, you may remain under the same conditions until a decision is made. Your original document may have expired on its face; your lawful presence has not. It applies only if the application went in on time and only while you remain in Canada.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I work or study while my extension is pending?',

  {
    q: 'My status has already expired. What now?',
    a: 'There is a restoration mechanism in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations for temporary residents who lose status, subject to a time limit set by the regulations that runs from the day status was lost. It is not automatic, IRCC charges a restoration fee on top of the extension fee, and it is refusable. Throughout that period you are out of status in Canada — restoration, if granted, gives you status going forward but does not erase the gap. Check the current time limit and fees on IRCC’s own pages before relying on either.',

  {
    q: 'Is overstaying a small administrative matter?',
    a: 'No. Remaining in Canada without status can lead to removal, and it becomes part of your immigration history — available to officers assessing later applications to Canada, and often disclosable to other countries. A recorded overstay is difficult to explain away afterwards.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I extend from outside Canada?',
    a: 'No. A visitor record is issued to people inside Canada. If you have already left, the question is a fresh visit application from abroad, not an extension.',

          <p>
            Canada separates the right to travel from the right to remain. The visitor visa in your
            passport is issued abroad and does one thing: it lets you board a flight and present
            yourself at a Canadian port of entry. It is not an admission and it does not fix the
            length of your stay.
          </p>
          <p>
            How long you may stay is decided at the border by an officer, and evidenced either by a
            stamp in your passport or by a visitor record — a separate document with its own expiry
            date. That date, not the visa expiry, is the one you must plan around.
          </p>
          <p>
            The practical consequence is uncomfortable. Someone holding a visa valid for several
            years may have been admitted for a much shorter period. They read the visa, assume they
            are covered, and are out of status without ever intending to break a rule. It is one of
            the most common ways an overstay happens by accident.

              <p>
                If your extension application is submitted before your current status expires, and you
                stay in Canada, you may remain lawfully under the same conditions until a decision is
                made. This is maintained status — older material calls it implied status.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is worth being precise about what it is. It is not a new authorisation and it is
                not an approval. It is a continuation of what you already held, on the same terms, for
                as long as the file is open. It ends when the decision is made, and it ends if you
                leave Canada.
              </p>
              <p>
                It also depends entirely on the timing of the application. Filed one day late, it does
                not exist at all — and that is the difference between waiting lawfully and being in
                Canada without status.

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            The Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations provide a mechanism for a temporary
            resident who has lost status to apply to have it restored, without leaving Canada. It is
            available only for a limited period running from the day status was lost, and only where
            the loss was for reasons the regulations cover — an expired authorised stay being the most
            common.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three things about restoration are consistently underestimated. First, it is discretionary
            and refusable; it is not a form you file to make the problem go away. Second, you are out
            of status throughout — restoration does not backdate anything, and there is no maintained
            status while it is pending. Third, the period you were out of status becomes part of your
            record. Restoration lets you carry on lawfully; it does not delete what happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            The deadline is fixed by regulation and runs from the date status was lost, not from the
            date you noticed — the current length of that window is published by{' '}
            <a
              href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/extend-stay/after-apply.html"

            </a>
            . If you think you may have fallen out of status, the useful action is to
            establish the actual date immediately and take advice on the same day, not to wait and see
            whether anyone raises it.
          </p>

        <div className="mt-10">
          <Callout title="What an overstay actually costs you">
            <p>
              Remaining in Canada without status can lead to enforcement and removal. Beyond that, it
              becomes part of your immigration history — visible to officers assessing any future
              application to Canada, and relevant to other countries whose forms ask whether you have
              ever overstayed or been refused entry anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              People underestimate this because nothing visible happens at first. The consequence can
              surface years later, in an application that is then harder to argue. If you are
              close to your date, treat it as urgent while you still have the easier options.

          <p>
            <strong>Reading the visa expiry instead of the status expiry.</strong> A frequent cause of
            avoidable overstays. The two dates are set separately and the visa is often the later of
            the two.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming no stamp means no limit.</strong> Being admitted without a stamp or a
            visitor record does not mean the stay is open-ended. A default authorised period applies.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Filing on the last day.</strong> A payment failure, a portal problem or a missing
            document on the final day removes maintained status entirely and pushes you into
            restoration territory for the sake of a week’s planning.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Leaving Canada while the extension is pending.</strong> This ends maintained
            status. Returning then depends on your travel document and the officer at the port, and
            people are surprised at the border.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Thin reasons for staying longer.</strong> An extension is assessed on genuineness.
            A vague wish to stay, with no funds shown and weakening ties at home, reads as an intention
            to remain — which is the ground on which visitor applications are refused.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Using extensions to stay indefinitely.</strong> Repeated extensions with no
            departure and no clear purpose invite the conclusion that you are not a temporary visitor.
            If your real goal is to remain in Canada, that needs a different plan.

            Fees, processing times and application channels change. We do not print those figures here,
