  {
    q: 'I was refused a visitor visa. Can I use an eTA instead?',
    a: 'No. This is the most common reason people reach this page, and it is worth being blunt: the eTA is not an alternative channel, an appeal, or a second attempt. If you were refused, the honest next step is to understand why the officer refused you and whether that concern can be answered.',

    q: 'I am a Pakistani citizen but a permanent resident of the United States. What applies to me?',
    a: 'Documented US permanent resident status changes what is required at the Canadian border, and the rules for that group have themselves changed in recent years.

    q: 'I hold a valid US visitor visa. Does that let me use an eTA?',

    q: 'Do I need an eTA if I am only changing planes in Canada?',
    a: 'Transit is governed by its own set of rules rather than treated as an ordinary visit, and IRCC operates a separate transit visa alongside the eTA. Which of the two applies — and whether any transit exemption covers you — depends on your nationality, how you arrive and where you are going. Do not assume that changing planes needs nothing. Check your route on IRCC’s transit page before you book, because the airline enforces this at check-in.',
  },
  {
    q: 'A website is offering to get me an eTA quickly for a fee. Is that legitimate?',
    a: 'The application is made on IRCC’s own website, and the government fee is published there. Sites that charge a premium to submit the same form are reselling something you can do yourself, and some collect passport details without any authority to do so. If a site promises an eTA to a nationality that is not eligible for one, it is selling something that does not exist.',

  {
    q: 'How much does an eTA cost and how long is it valid?',
    a: 'IRCC publishes the current fee and the validity period on its own site, and both are subject to change. We do not print those figures here, because a number that is correct today becomes a liability on a page you might read next year. Take them from canada.ca on the day you apply.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Canada screens travellers before they board, not only when they land. For people who need
            a visa, that screening happens through the visa application itself. For people whose
            nationality does not require a visa, there was historically no pre-boarding check at all —
            and the eTA was introduced to close that gap.
          </p>
          <p>
            An eTA is an electronic record linked to a specific passport, applied for online, that
            authorises a visa-exempt traveller to board a flight to Canada. It is a light-touch check
            against admissibility and security records. It is not an assessment of your ties, your
            funds, your employment, or your reasons for travelling — because those questions are what
            a visa application is for.
          </p>
          <p>
            That difference is the whole point. The eTA is a thin check because it applies to
            nationalities Canada has decided may travel without an individual visa assessment. It is
            not a faster version of the visa. It is a different instrument, aimed at different people.

              . Pakistan is not on it. For a person travelling on a Pakistani passport, the route to Canada as a visitor
              is a temporary resident visa — an application with biometrics, supporting documents and
              an officer’s assessment behind it.
            </p>
            <p>
              This matters because the eTA is frequently presented online as a quick alternative for
              people who find the visa daunting or who have already been refused. It is not. Submitting
              an eTA application for a nationality that is not eligible does not create an entitlement;
              it produces nothing usable, and it costs you time you may not have before your travel
              date.{' '}

              <p>
                There are genuine exceptions, and it would be dishonest to pretend otherwise. They are
                narrow, they turn on documented status rather than on circumstance, and they are worth
                stating carefully because half-remembered versions of them cause a great deal of
                wasted money.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first concerns lawful permanent residents of the United States. Documented US
                permanent residence changes what Canada requires of a traveller regardless of their
                nationality. What exactly is required has itself been revised in recent years and
                differs by mode of arrival, so this is a case to confirm against IRCC’s current
                published requirements rather than against anything you were told previously.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second concerns a designated list of visa-required countries whose citizens may,
                if they hold certain other documents, apply for an eTA instead of a visa for air travel
                only. That list is set by IRCC and changes. Pakistan is not on it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both exceptions share a shape: they are documentary, they are checkable, and neither
                is available on the basis of merely intending to travel or having travelled widely
                before.

          <p>
            <strong>Treating the eTA as a route around a refusal.</strong> Someone is refused a
            visitor visa, reads that Canada has a simple online authorisation, and applies for that
            instead. Nothing usable comes of it. The underlying refusal — usually a concern about
            purpose, funds or intention to leave — remains entirely unaddressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Paying a third-party site.</strong> Many websites replicate the government form,
            charge well above the official fee, and present themselves as an official channel. At
            best you have overpaid for something you could do yourself. At worst you have handed your
            passport details to a party with no authority to hold them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming a US visa is enough.</strong> A valid US visa helps in some contexts and
            for some nationalities. It does not, on its own, make a Pakistani passport holder eligible
            for a Canadian eTA. People discover this at the airport.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Booking transit through Canada without checking.</strong> A cheaper fare with a
            connection through a Canadian airport can require authorisation that the traveller does not
            hold. The airline enforces this at check-in, and by that point the fare may not be
            refundable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Renewing the passport and forgetting the link.</strong> For travellers who do
            legitimately hold an eTA, the authorisation is tied to the passport it was issued against.
            A new passport does not carry it forward.

              If you hold a Pakistani passport, are travelling from Pakistan, and hold no permanent

              is better received now than at an airline counter.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also does not suit anyone hoping the online form is a lighter test than the visa. It
              is lighter precisely because it applies to people Canada has already decided not to
