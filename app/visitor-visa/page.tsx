/**
 * The hub page for temporary visits to Canada.
 *
 * This page is deliberately CONCEPTUAL — it explains the shape of the temporary
 * resident regime (TRV vs eTA, Super Visa, business visitors, extensions) and
 * routes people to the applicant-facing pages. The Pakistan-specific visit-visa
 * page lives at /canada-visit-visa; refusals go to /canada-visa-refused.
 *
 * NO figures appear here on purpose: no fees, no processing times, no insurance
 * minimums, no approval or refusal rates. Every number a reader needs is named
 * and pointed at IRCC / Open Government. See lib/facts.ts.
 *
 * Do not reintroduce refusal-rate rankings ("the most refused category"). IRCC's
 * published data does not support that for visitor visas, and the ordering moves
 * year to year. Link the dataset instead.

If you hold a second nationality, that can change the answer, and it is worth checking before you file anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Why is the visitor visa refused so often?',
    a: 'Because it is decided on a prediction, not a checklist. The officer has to be satisfied you will leave at the end of your authorised stay, and if they are not satisfied, they refuse. Nothing in the application forces them to be satisfied — which is why complete, honest, well-evidenced files still get refused, and why anyone promising you an approval is selling something they don’t own.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does wanting to immigrate later ruin my visitor application?',
    a: 'Not by itself. Canadian law recognises dual intent: wanting permanent residence eventually does not disqualify you from temporary status, provided the officer is satisfied you will leave at the end of the stay you are asking for. What does damage a case is concealing the intention and being caught, or asking to visit when what you actually want is to stay.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much money do I need to show?',
    a: 'There is no published figure to hit, and we won’t invent one. What matters is that the funds are proportionate to the trip you have described, that they are yours, and that they have a traceable history. A large balance with no explanation hurts more than a modest one that clearly came from your salary.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What does it cost and how long does it take?',
    a: 'Two separate things: the government fee paid to IRCC, and our professional fee. Both the fee schedule and the current processing times are published by IRCC and both change, so we point you at the source rather than print a number here that may be wrong by the time you read it — see the IRCC fee list at canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/fees.html and the processing-times tool at canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html. Our own fee is quoted in writing for your file before you commit.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I work or study on a visitor visa?',
    a: 'No. A visitor is not authorised to work, and study is limited to short courses under the rules in force. Business visitors are an exception only in a narrow sense — you may conduct business here for a foreign employer, but you may not take up employment in Canada. If the real plan is to work, the visitor route is the wrong application and filing it can damage the right one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My visitor visa was refused. Can I just apply again?',
    a: 'You can, but reapplying with the same file usually produces the same result. The useful first step is understanding what the officer actually decided — the refusal letter, and where appropriate the officer’s notes — and then deciding honestly whether a stronger reapplication or a challenge to the decision is the better route.',

              <p>
                Canadian regulations require an officer to be satisfied that a temporary resident
                will leave Canada by the end of the period authorised for their stay. That is the
                whole decision. Everything else — the bank statements, the invitation letter, the
                hotel booking — exists only as evidence pointing at that one prediction.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is worth being precise about the burden. The officer does not have to prove you
                will overstay. You have to satisfy them that you won’t. A file that is merely not
                suspicious is not the same as a file that is convincing, and that gap is where most
                refusals live.
              </p>
              <p>
                The law also recognises what people call dual intent: wanting to become a permanent
                resident one day does not, on its own, bar you from temporary status. What matters
                is whether the officer believes you will comply with the temporary status you are
                asking for right now.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Refusal is a common outcome on this route, and the reason is structural, not personal.
            Permanent-residence streams like Express Entry are largely scored: the criteria are
            published, and you meet them or you don’t. A visitor application is not scored at all.
            It is judged on an officer’s assessment of your intentions under the temporary resident
            rules, and it carries no appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division — only judicial
            review in the Federal Court. IRCC publishes its own approval and refusal figures, which
            move year to year; if you want the current picture, read it from the source rather than
            from a consultant’s website, including ours.{' '}

          <p>
            That subjectivity cuts both ways. It means a genuine applicant with a thin travel
            history can be refused. It also means a case that was refused once can succeed later on
            better evidence, or be overturned where the decision was unreasonable. What it never
            means is that anyone can guarantee you an outcome.{' '}

            One practical consequence: a weak application filed today sits on your immigration
            record for years and has to be declared on everything you file afterwards. Applying
            early and badly is more expensive than waiting and applying properly.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            A visitor visa is travel permission, not status. The officer at the port of entry
            decides how long you may stay, and that period — not the expiry date printed on the visa
            — is what governs you. If nothing is stamped or issued, a default period applies; if the
            officer writes a shorter date, the shorter date wins.
          </p>
          <p>
            To stay beyond that period you apply, from inside Canada and before your status expires,
            for a{' '}
            <em className="not-italic font-semibold text-ink-900">visitor record</em> — a document
            that extends your stay and states its new end date. It is not a visa and it does not let
            you re-enter Canada; if you leave, you need valid travel permission to come back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Applying before expiry matters. Do it in time and you generally keep lawful status while
            the application is pending. Miss the date and you are out of status, with a restoration
            process that is time-limited and considerably less forgiving. The default length of stay,
            the restoration deadline and the fees are all set by IRCC and change, so confirm them at
            the source before you rely on them —{' '}
