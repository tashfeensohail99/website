  {
    q: 'Is “business visitor” a separate visa I apply for?',
    a: 'No. It is a category of visitor. You apply for the same temporary resident visa, or travel on an electronic travel authorisation if your nationality and circumstances allow it, and you are admitted as a business visitor by the officer at the port of entry based on what you are actually coming to do. Which document applies to you depends on your citizenship and on how you are travelling, and IRCC revises those lists from time to time — check your own position on IRCC’s entry-requirements tool before you plan around either one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who decides whether I am a business visitor or a worker?',
    a: 'Ultimately the border services officer at the port of entry, on the day, based on your documents and your answers. A visa in your passport is permission to travel and be examined — it is not a ruling that your planned activity is visitor activity.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My Canadian client wants to pay me directly for the days I am there. Is that a problem?',
    a: 'It works directly against you. One of the tests is that your primary remuneration for the activity comes from outside Canada. Payment from the Canadian entity for the work performed here is exactly the fact pattern that suggests you have entered the Canadian labour market. Structure the commercial relationship as a payment from the Canadian business to your foreign employer, not to you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I am going to install machinery my company sold to a Canadian buyer. Do I need a permit?',
    a: 'It depends on the contract, not on the machinery. If the installation, commissioning or servicing is part of the original sale, lease, warranty or service agreement between the foreign seller and the Canadian buyer, it is generally business visitor activity. If it is a separate job you were engaged for outside that agreement, it generally is not. Carry the contract.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if I get this wrong?',
    a: 'Working without authorisation is a breach of the conditions of your stay, not a technicality. It can lead to removal, and it is a fact that must be disclosed on future applications. Separately, misrepresenting what you came to do can lead to a finding of misrepresentation and a period of inadmissibility — and a finding does not require that you intended to mislead, which is why an inaccurate description matters even when it was careless rather than dishonest. This is the reason to resolve the question before you fly, not at the counter.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What should I be carrying with me?',
    a: 'A letter from your employer outside Canada stating your position, that you remain their employee and that they continue to pay you; a letter from the Canadian party explaining the purpose of the visit; and the underlying commercial document — the purchase order, sales contract, warranty or service agreement — where the activity depends on one. Officers ask for the document, not the description.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can a business visitor stay long term and then apply from inside Canada?',
    a: 'That is not what the category is for, and treating it as a back door is a common way people lose status. A business visitor activity is discrete and connected to a business outside Canada. If your intention is to be in Canada working, the honest route is a work permit — a different application with different requirements.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee I will be admitted as a business visitor?',
    a: 'No. Admission is decided by an officer at the port of entry and that decision is not ours to make. What we can do is assess honestly whether your planned activity sits inside the definition, and tell you plainly when it does not.',

      <Section tone="paper">
        <SectionHeading
          eyebrow="The distinction that matters"
          title="Not a lighter kind of work permit"
        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Canadian immigration law separates two things that sound similar and are treated very
            differently. One is <strong>work</strong> — activity that requires authorisation, normally
            a work permit. The other is <strong>business visitor activity</strong> — a defined set of
            international business dealings that a visitor may carry out without one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Business visitor status is not a permit you hold, and not a lighter category of work
            permit you can be granted. It is a description of what you are doing. Either your activity
            falls inside the definition, in which case no permit is needed, or it does not, in which
            case you needed a permit and did not have one.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is why this distinction carries more weight than most of what is written about
            visitor visas. A refused visa costs you an application. Being admitted as a business
            visitor and then doing work is unauthorised work: it can end your stay, and it becomes a
            disclosed fact on every application you ever make afterwards.

              Read the three substantive tests together and one picture emerges. Your employer is
              abroad, your pay is abroad, the profits of the activity land abroad, and your presence
              in Canada is a discrete piece of that foreign business’s dealings with Canada. Shift any
              one of those anchors into Canada and the description starts to fail — not because of a
              rule about that one factor, but because the activity has stopped being international and
              started being Canadian employment.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>Using the category as a shortcut to work.</strong> The most damaging one. Someone
            is told that entering as a business visitor lets them start work while a permit is sorted
            out. It does not. The activity is either visitor activity or it is unauthorised work, and
            the intention behind it makes the second version worse rather than better.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Technical work outside the warranty.</strong> A technician travels believing that
            servicing equipment is always permitted. It is permitted where it sits inside the original
            sale, lease, warranty or service agreement. Engaged separately for an installation job, the
            same person needs a permit. The document decides it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Being paid locally for convenience.</strong> A Canadian client offers to settle
            fees or per-diems directly because it is simpler. It quietly moves the source of
            remuneration into Canada and undermines the basis on which you were admitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>The visit that never ends.</strong> A defined trip extends, then extends again,
            until the person is in substance running or staffing a Canadian operation. The category
            does not stretch to fit; the description simply stops being true.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Arriving with a story instead of documents.</strong> Officers assess what you can
            show. An articulate explanation with no employer letter, no Canadian letter and no
            contract is a weak position at the port of entry.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Describing it one way on the application and another at the border.</strong> The
            two accounts are compared. A mismatch is not merely awkward — a material misdescription can
            support a finding of misrepresentation and a resulting period of inadmissibility, whether or
            not you meant to mislead. If you have

              Business visitor status does not suit anyone whose real intention is employment in
              Canada, however short. It does not suit a technician engaged for an installation
              contract that is separate from the original sale. It does not suit someone whose Canadian
              client will be paying them. It does not suit a person hoping to arrive, look for work and
