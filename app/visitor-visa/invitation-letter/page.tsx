  },
  {
    q: 'Does an invitation letter mean the visa will be approved?',
    a: 'No. IRCC states plainly that a letter of invitation does not guarantee a visa will be issued. Officers assess whether you are a genuine temporary visitor who will leave at the end of the authorised stay, and a letter is one input into that assessment. Applications with careful, well-drafted letters are refused where the applicant’s own circumstances did not support a temporary visit.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the host legally responsible for me?',
    a: 'IRCC’s own guidance says that writing a letter of invitation does not make the host legally responsible for the visitor once they are in Canada. It also says the host should write the letter in good faith, tell the truth, and intend to keep the promises made in it. So it is not the formal undertaking that sponsoring a family member for permanent residence creates — but a host who makes claims that turn out to be false has put their own credibility in front of an officer.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does the letter need to be notarised?',
    a: 'IRCC does not impose a blanket notarisation requirement, but its guidance says some visa offices do, and it tells hosts to contact the office handling the visitor’s application to find out. Check the instructions that apply to the office handling applications from Pakistan before deciding. Notarising a letter proves who signed it — it does not make the contents more persuasive.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My host has a strong income. Is that enough?',
    a: 'It helps establish that the visit is affordable, but it does not establish that you will return. Those are different questions and officers treat them separately. Applicants often build a file around the host and leave their own side of it thin, which is exactly the imbalance that draws a refusal.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should the letter promise that I will return home?',
    a: 'A host can say what they understand your plans to be. They cannot vouch for what you will do, and an officer knows that. What actually addresses the question is your own evidence — employment, business, property, dependants, prior travel that you returned from.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I was refused before. Will a better invitation letter fix it?',
    a: 'Rarely on its own. A refusal is usually about the officer’s assessment of your ties, your funds, or the credibility of the stated purpose. Until you know which, rewriting the letter is guesswork. The refusal notes are the place to start.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I use a template I found online?',
    a: 'A template can help with structure. The risk is that templates carry sentences that do not apply to you, and a letter containing facts that do not match the rest of the file is worse than a plain one that does. Anything in the letter should be something the host would say the same way if asked directly.',

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            An invitation letter is a letter written by someone in Canada — usually a relative,
            sometimes a friend or a business contact — confirming that they have invited you, what
            the visit is for, how long it is expected to last, and what arrangements have been made
            for where you will stay and who is paying.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is the whole of it. It is a piece of supporting evidence submitted alongside your
            application. It sits next to your passport, your financial documents, your employment or
            business records, and your explanation of purpose. It does not sit above them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason this needs saying is that a great many applicants from Pakistan treat the
            letter as the centre of the file. Considerable effort goes into its wording, and
            comparatively little into the evidence that officers actually weigh. In our consultations
            that inversion is a recurring shape in refused visitor applications.

              This is the single most useful thing on this page. If an officer is not satisfied that
              you are a genuine temporary visitor — because your funds do not support the trip you
              have described, because your ties to Pakistan are thin, because your stated purpose does
              not hold together — then no amount of care in the invitation letter changes that
              conclusion. The letter is not the part of the file that answers those questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reverse also holds: plain wording is not usually where a sound application comes
              apart. Put the effort where the decision is made. Nobody — us included — can tell you how
              an officer will decide.

              <p>
                A letter is an assertion. The documents behind it are what allow an officer to accept
                the assertion. A host who writes that they are a Canadian citizen, will accommodate
                you at their home, and will cover part of the cost has made three claims — each of
                which is either evidenced or not.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where the host is offering financial support, that support has to be visible in
                something an officer can read. Where the host is offering accommodation, the address
                and the host’s connection to it should be consistent with everything else in the file.
                A letter that promises more than the accompanying documents show is a liability, not
                an asset.
              </p>
              <p>
                Requirements differ between offices and are revised from time to time. IRCC publishes
                the current guidance for letters of invitation on its own site, and that is the version

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>The letter contradicts the application.</strong> The host writes that you are
            coming for a wedding in one month; your forms give a different purpose or a different
            period. Small inconsistencies between the letter and the rest of the file do real damage,
            because they invite the officer to doubt the whole account rather than one document.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Promised support that nobody can evidence.</strong> A host writes that they will
            cover all costs, then provides nothing that shows they can. The application is now weaker
            than if the letter had simply said you were funding the trip yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A relationship stated loosely.</strong> “Family friend” and “uncle” used
            interchangeably, or a relationship that does not appear anywhere else in the documents.
            Where the relationship is real, describe it exactly; where it is distant, say so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A letter written by someone other than the host.</strong> Agent-drafted letters
            tend to share phrasing, and phrasing that appears across unrelated applications is
            noticeable. Worse, the host has now signed statements they did not compose and may not be
            able to stand behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating the letter as the remedy for a previous refusal.</strong> If you were
            refused before, the reasons are recorded. Rewriting the invitation letter without knowing
            what the officer actually found is guesswork, and it is a familiar way to spend money on a
            second application that runs into the same problem as the first.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Anything untrue.</strong> An invented host, an invented event, or a fabricated
            relationship is misrepresentation. It carries consequences well beyond this application,
            for you and potentially for the person who signed the letter.

              An invitation letter does not suit an applicant whose real difficulty is elsewhere. If
              your funds do not support the trip, if you have no employment or business to return to,
              if your stated purpose does not match your circumstances, or if you have a refusal
              history you have not yet understood — the letter is not the document that answers any of
              that, and polishing it is time spent on the wrong thing.

              It is also the wrong focus for someone whose real objective is to settle in Canada. To be
              clear about the law: wanting permanent residence does not by itself disqualify you from a
              visitor visa. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act expressly provides that an
              intention to become a permanent resident does not prevent someone from becoming a
              temporary resident, provided the officer is satisfied they will leave Canada by the end of
              the period authorised for their stay. What that means in practice is that the officer must
              still be satisfied about departure — and a host’s letter is not the document that satisfies
              it. If settling is the goal, the invitation letter is not the lever;{' '}
