A Super Visa is only for parents and grandparents of Canadian citizens and permanent residents, and it authorises a continuous stay measured in years per entry, extendable from inside Canada. In exchange, it asks for things an ordinary visitor visa does not: an income-backed undertaking from your host, private medical insurance, and an immigration medical exam.',

            <p>
              An ordinary visitor visa lets you come to Canada for a short trip. The stay authorised
              when you land is measured in months, and each time you want longer you are back in front
              of the system asking for it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Super Visa is narrower and longer. It is open only to the parents and grandparents
              of Canadian citizens and permanent residents, and it authorises a continuous stay
              measured in years per entry, on a visa valid for years beyond that, with the option to
              extend from inside Canada. For a family that wants a grandparent present for a
              grandchild’s childhood rather than for a wedding, that is the whole difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              What it is not is a path to staying. It is visitor status. Your parents cannot work on
              it, it does not accumulate toward permanent residence, and it does not convert into
              anything. It also carries conditions an ordinary visitor visa does not — an
              income-backed undertaking from the inviting child, private medical insurance, and an
              immigration medical exam.
            </p>
            <p>
              The specific numbers — the length of stay, the income threshold, the minimum insurance
              coverage, the government fee — are set by IRCC and have been revised more than once in
              recent years. We deliberately don’t print them here.{' '}

            <p>
              The undertaking is worth understanding properly, because families read it as paperwork
              and it is not. Your child in Canada is putting their name to a promise that they will
              support you financially while you are there, and IRCC tests that promise against their
              filed income for a household counted as if you were already living in it. Adding two
              parents to a household of four changes the number that has to be met. It is the single
              most common place a Super Visa file falls over.
            </p>
            <p>
              The insurance is the second. The requirement is not simply “have travel insurance” — the
              policy has to cover healthcare, hospitalisation and repatriation at IRCC’s minimum
              level, run for the minimum period from entry that IRCC sets, and come from an insurer
              IRCC accepts. That last point has changed: policies from outside Canada can now
              qualify, but only where the insurer is authorised in the particular way IRCC specifies.
              A cheap policy that fails that test costs you the application. The coverage amount, the
              minimum period and the insurer test are all published by IRCC on its{' '}

                You can apply whenever you are ready — there is no intake window and no lottery. The
                status is temporary: visitor, no work, no route to citizenship, and private insurance
                to be maintained for as long as your parents keep coming.

              <p>

                This gives permanent residence, with provincial health coverage, the right to work,
                and eventual eligibility for citizenship. The trade-offs are access and commitment:
                IRCC opens the intake periodically and selects from a pool of interested sponsors, so
                you cannot simply decide to apply, and the sponsor signs a support undertaking that
                runs for many years.
              </p>
              <p>
                It suits families whose goal is that the parents live in Canada, not visit it — and
                whose sponsor can meet a sustained income requirement.

              In practice the two are often used together rather than chosen between: submit interest
              in sponsorship when the intake opens, and apply for the Super Visa so your parents may
              be able to be in Canada in the meantime. The two are separate applications, each
              assessed on its own merits by IRCC — and being in Canada as a visitor does not create a
              right to stay if the sponsorship does not come through.

              If the goal is for your parents to settle in Canada permanently, this is the wrong
              route — it does not lead there, and years on a Super Visa build nothing toward it. If
              your child in Canada cannot meet the income requirement for a household that includes
              your parents, the application fails on that alone, and buying insurance first is money
              thrown away. If you are looking for a way for a parent to work in Canada, this visa
              forbids it. And if the person inviting you is a sibling, an uncle, a cousin or a family
              friend rather than your own child or grandchild, you are not eligible at all — no matter
              how the relationship is described on the invitation letter.
