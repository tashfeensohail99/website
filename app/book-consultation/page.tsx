/**
 * The consultation. Free since 2026-07-21 — see lib/site.ts for why the
 * honesty anchor moved from the fee to a written summary.
 *
 * The fee's job is QUALIFICATION, not revenue. A small paid step is the cheapest
 * filter there is between a serious enquiry and the WhatsApp firehose, and — for
 * a buyer who has been warned about immigration scams their whole life — a fee
 * that credits back reads as confidence rather than a toll.
 *
 * WhatsApp leads, and the form sits below it — for the audience in Pakistan and the
 * Gulf, WhatsApp beats a form on every axis: less friction, a 24-hour service
 * window, and no reply forced into a paid template.
 *
 * The form is for the people who won't use it, and since the consultation went
 * free it carries the qualifying weight the PKR 5,000 fee used to. It asks the
 * questions a lawyer asks first — refusals above all — so effort filters where
 * price used to. Still NO identity documents: no CNIC, no passport. Those belong
 * at retainer, behind auth, not on a public page.
