/**
 * Sponsoring dependent children.
 *
 * Two ideas do most of the work on this page. First: whether a child qualifies is
 * fixed by a date, not by the day an officer happens to look at the file — so delay
 * is the enemy. Second: a child who was never declared and examined on the parent's
 * own application can be barred from ever being sponsored by that parent. Both are
 * quiet, both are irreversible, and both are decided long before anyone applies.

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'What exactly is the “age lock-in” date?',
    a: 'It is the date, set by the Regulations, at which the child’s age stops being reassessed. For most programs — including family-class sponsorship — that is the date the complete application is received, but some categories lock in earlier, so confirm which applies to your route. A child who met the age condition on that date continues to be treated as a dependent child even if they have a birthday while the file is being processed. What the lock-in does not do is preserve marital status — the child must still be unmarried and not in a common-law relationship when permanent residence is confirmed.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My child is close to the age limit. What should I do?',
    a: 'Move, and move on a complete application rather than a fast one. An incomplete package that is returned does not hold a date. It is a common way for families to lose a child from an application, and preparation is what reduces the risk — though no amount of preparation puts the date itself under your control.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the age limit?',
    a: 'We do not publish it here. The definition in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations has been amended more than once in recent years, and which version applies depends on when the application was received. IRCC publishes the current rule and the transitional dates on its own site. Read it there, on the day you need it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can my child’s own child come too?',
    a: 'Yes, in principle. A dependent child of your dependent child is itself within the definition of a family member, so a grandchild can be included where the chain of dependency holds at each link. It has to hold at every link — if the middle generation no longer qualifies, the generation below usually falls with them.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Should I include my child on my own PR application or sponsor separately?',
    a: 'If you have not yet become a permanent resident, include them. Declaring and having every family member examined on your own application — accompanying or not — is what preserves the ability to sponsor them later. Sponsoring separately later is the route for children born or adopted after you landed, or for a child who was properly declared and examined but did not travel with you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I did not declare a child on my own application. Can I sponsor them now?',
    a: 'This is serious and you should get advice from a licensed representative before you file anything. The Regulations exclude from the family class a person who was a non-accompanying family member on the sponsor’s own application and was not examined, subject to narrow exceptions set out in the Regulations themselves. The practical effect is usually a bar on sponsoring that person. Limited relief measures have existed at various times, and humanitarian and compassionate submissions are sometimes available, but neither is a route you should assume applies to you, and we cannot say in advance whether one will. Bring the actual file to a consultation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I have to meet an income requirement?',
    a: 'Sponsoring your own dependent child does not generally attract the income test that applies to other family-class sponsorships — unless that child has dependent children of their own. You must still be eligible to sponsor at all: certain defaults, convictions and prior undertakings can bar you. We do not publish income figures here because they are revised. IRCC publishes the current income requirement and the full list of sponsorship bars on canada.ca, and the underlying rule sits in section 133 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations on the Justice Laws website.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do adopted children work?',
    a: 'An adoption completed abroad is not automatically recognised for immigration. In substance the adoption has to be genuine, in the child’s best interests, to have created a real parent-child relationship and severed the previous legal one, and not to have been arranged primarily to obtain status in Canada. The province or territory you intend to live in has a role, and where both countries are party to the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption, that process must be followed. Where the adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen there is also a citizenship-grant route as an alternative to sponsorship — the two have different consequences, and the choice should be made deliberately.',
  },
  {
    q: 'The other parent will not consent. Does that stop the application?',
    a: 'It can. Where the other parent has custody or access rights, an officer will want to see that the child’s removal from the country is lawful — a custody order, a consent, or a court decision. Sponsoring a child out of a shared-custody situation without addressing this is one of the more predictable refusals we see.',

              Note what the definition does not require. It does not require the child to live with
              you, and for a child under the age limit it does not require you to prove that you have
              been supporting them. Financial dependency only becomes a live question for the
              over-age exception. Conversely, a child you support entirely but who has married is not
              a dependent child — the marital-status condition has no exception attached to it.

            <Prose>
              <p>
                Children have birthdays while applications sit in processing. If eligibility were
                assessed at the moment of decision, every delay in the system would cost families a
                child. So the Regulations fix the age at a point in time rather than at the moment
                of decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Which point in time depends on the program. For most programs, including family-class
                sponsorship, it is the date the complete application is received. But the Regulations
                set out a list of category-specific lock-in dates — a provincial nomination, for
                example, can lock the age at the date the province receives the nomination
                application, which is earlier. Check which one governs your route before you rely on
                a date.
              </p>
              <p>
                That is the whole of the age lock-in. A child who was within the age limit on the
                relevant lock-in date stays within it, however long the file takes afterwards. A
                child who was over it on that date does not come back into range because of anything
                that happens later.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two consequences follow, and they are the reason this page exists. First, the word{' '}
                <em>complete</em> is doing real work — a package returned as incomplete does not hold
                a date, and a family that thought it had filed in time may find it has not. Second,
                the lock-in freezes age and nothing else. Marital status is assessed on the ongoing
                basis: a child who marries during processing ceases to qualify.

            , or any other route to permanent residence. Every family member is declared and
            examined, accompanying or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sponsorship is the separate mechanism you use once you already hold status: you give an
            undertaking, and the child applies for permanent residence under the family class. It is
            the route for a child born or adopted after you landed, and for a child who was properly
            declared and examined on your own application but did not travel at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason the distinction is worth understanding before you are in it is that the first
            stage governs the second. Subject to narrow exceptions in the Regulations, a child who
            was a non-accompanying family member on your application and was not examined is excluded
            from the family class in relation to you. In practice that usually bars sponsoring them,
            and the fact that the omission was innocent does not by itself lift the bar. Whether one
            of the exceptions reaches your facts is a question for a licensed representative looking
            at the actual file.

            <p>
              This is among the most damaging errors we see in family immigration files, and it is
              usually made in good faith. A child from an earlier marriage who will stay with
              their mother. A child born between the medical examination and the flight. A child the
              parent did not know about at the time. An agent who advised that leaving a name off
              would make the file simpler.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Regulations do not generally weigh the reason. If the child was a non-accompanying
              family member and was not examined, the sponsorship route to reunite is normally
              closed, subject to the narrow exceptions the Regulations themselves set out. Where the
              omission was deliberate, there may be misrepresentation on top of it, which carries its
              own bar on future applications — IRCC publishes the current period and consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
              Relief measures have existed at different times, and humanitarian and compassionate
              submissions are sometimes possible, but neither is something to plan around. If this
              has already happened in your family, bring the actual file to a consultation rather
              than a summary of it — the outcome depends on precisely what was declared, when, and on
              which form.

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Families are often surprised by this. A completed adoption under the law of another
            country establishes a relationship there; it does not by itself establish that the child
            is your child for Canadian immigration purposes. The assessment is substantive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In broad terms, an officer looks for an adoption that is in the child’s best interests,
            that has created a genuine parent-child relationship, that has severed the pre-existing
            legal parent-child relationship, and that was not entered into primarily to obtain status
            in Canada. Adoptions arranged to move a relative’s child are a recognised pattern and are
            examined closely.
          </p>
          <p>
            The province or territory where you intend to live has a role in the process, and where
            both countries are party to the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption, that framework
            has to be followed rather than worked around. Adoptions of adults are treated differently
            again, and are narrower.
          </p>
          <p>
            Where the adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen, there is also a direct citizenship-grant
            route as an alternative to sponsoring the child for permanent residence. The two paths
            have different requirements and different long-term consequences for the child, including
            for the child’s own ability to pass citizenship on. That choice should be made
            deliberately at the start, not discovered halfway through.

            <strong>Filing an incomplete package against a deadline.</strong> The family knows the
            child is close to the age limit, rushes, and the package comes back. Nothing was
            received, so no date was held. Preparing the package properly is what gives the lock-in
            a chance to hold; rushing an incomplete one does not.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A child who marries during processing.</strong> The age was locked; the marital
            status was not. This is avoidable if the family understands the condition before the
            wedding rather than after.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Custody and the other parent.</strong> Removing a child from Pakistan where
            another parent holds rights over them requires documentation that satisfies an officer.
            Applications proceed on the assumption it can be sorted out later, and it often cannot.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Over-age dependency claimed without medical evidence.</strong> The exception is
            not a general hardship provision. It requires a physical or mental condition, and
            substantial financial dependency that began before the age limit was reached, both
            evidenced.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Documents that do not agree with each other.</strong> Birth registrations issued
            long after the birth, names spelled differently across passport, NADRA record and school
            documents, a father’s name recorded inconsistently. These are ordinary in Pakistan and
            unremarkable to an officer if explained up front, and corrosive if left to be discovered.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Advice to leave a child off the form.</strong> Whoever gave it will not be there
            when the consequence arrives. See the section above; this one is not recoverable in the
            ordinary way.

              If your child was already over the age limit before you were in a position to file,
              this route is closed, and no filing strategy reopens it. If your child is married or in
              a common-law relationship, they are not a dependent child, whatever their age and
              whatever your support. If your child was a non-accompanying family member on your own
              application and was not examined, sponsorship is barred.
