        honestly whether your case is strong, fix what’s weak before it’s filed, and put the
        relationship evidence together properly.{' '}

                Permanent residents must be living in Canada. Citizens living abroad may sponsor a

              When you sponsor, you promise to provide for your relative’s basic needs — food,
              shelter, clothing, and the everyday requirements of living — so that they do not need
              to claim social assistance. If they do claim it, the province can recover what it paid

              Default has consequences beyond the money: it bars you from sponsoring anyone else

                stay in Canada while the application is processed. Leaving can put re-entry at risk,

          For most Pakistani applicants the question does not arise — the spouse is in Pakistan, so
          it’s an outland application, and the appeal right comes with it. Inland only becomes a real
          choice when your spouse is already in Canada on valid status. Where both are genuinely open,
          the honest trade is: being together sooner and working sooner, against giving up the
          strongest remedy available if the file goes wrong.

                Parent and grandparent sponsorship is capped, and it doesn’t work like the rest of
                the family class. You cannot simply file when you’re ready. IRCC opens an
                interest-to-sponsor step — a short form declaring you want to sponsor — during a
                defined window, and everyone who submits goes into a pool.

              <p>
                Invitations are then issued from that pool. Only people who are invited may submit a
                full application. Submitting interest is not applying, and being in the pool is not a
                queue position you can rely on — in the years IRCC has drawn from an existing pool
                rather than opening a fresh one, people who never registered had no way in at all.

                This stream also carries an income requirement measured over several consecutive tax

                A child is a dependant if they’re under the age set in the regulations and unmarried
                and not in a common-law relationship. There is also a separate category with no age
                limit: a child of any age who has depended substantially on a parent’s financial
                support since before that age because of a physical or mental condition.
              </p>
              <p>
                Age is generally assessed by reference to a fixed lock-in date rather than the date a
                decision is made, which is intended to stop a child ageing out purely because
                processing took time. Which date applies to your file is worth confirming precisely —
                it is one of the few places where a small factual point changes the whole outcome.

                Every family member must be declared and, where required, examined — including
                children who are not coming to Canada, children from a previous relationship, and
                children living with someone else.
              </p>
              <p>
                A family member who wasn’t declared and examined when you immigrated is generally
                excluded from ever being sponsored by you afterwards. This is the most common and
                most painful failure we see in this category, and it is usually not fraud — it is
                someone who assumed a child who wasn’t travelling didn’t need to be listed.

                Genetic testing is occasionally raised where documentary proof of a parent-child
