        No — and neither can anyone else. Your application is decided by an IRCC officer, and no
        consultant in Pakistan can overrule that. What we can do is tell you honestly whether your
        case is strong, fix what’s weak before it’s filed, and argue it properly.{' '}

  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need an IELTS band?',

              <p>
                Most Canadian work permits need an employer to prove no Canadian could do the job — an
                LMIA. It’s slow, it’s expensive, and you can’t even start it without an employer who
                already wants you.
              </p>
              <p>
                The C11 skips that. It’s for someone who will bring{' '}
                <em className="not-italic font-semibold text-ink-900">significant benefit</em> to
                Canada — typically by starting or buying a business there. You are the applicant and,
                in effect, the employer. There’s no LMIA, and no job offer to chase.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is not a shortcut and it is not easy. It’s a real business case, argued properly,
                with real money behind it. That’s precisely why most agents don’t touch it.
