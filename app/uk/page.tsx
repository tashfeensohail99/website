/**
 * The UK page's job is to kill two myths that are sold hard in Pakistan:
 * "self-sponsorship" as though it were a visa category, and the Expansion Worker
 * route as though it led to settlement. Both cost people real money.
 *
 * Only gov.uk-verified figures appear here (see lib/facts.ts). The £34,830 PhD
 * rate, £30,960 new-entrant rate and £25,000 floor are all in circulation, all
 * contradicted between sources, and none are stated on this page — copying a
 * competitor's numbers inherits their errors and their liability.

        No. There is no such category — it isn’t on the UK government’s list of visas. What people
        mean by it is setting up a UK company, getting it licensed as a sponsor, and having it
        sponsor you on a Skilled Worker visa. That is real, but it does not escape any of the Skilled
        Worker rules: the same £41,700, the same degree-level requirement, and a genuine vacancy.

  {
    q: 'Does the Expansion Worker route lead to settlement?',
    a: (
      <>
        No. It is for sending someone to set up a UK branch of an existing overseas business. It is
        capped at two years and does not lead to indefinite leave to remain. If your goal is to
        settle in the UK, this is not the door — despite how it is routinely mis-sold in Pakistan.

        It depends on the ground. Your refusal letter names a specific reason, and that reason tells
        you whether reapplying is worth it or whether you are about to waste another fee. Send us the
        letter and we’ll tell you honestly which it is.

        No — and neither can anyone else. Your visa is decided by a visa officer. What we can do is
        tell you honestly whether a route is real, whether your case is strong, and whether it is
        worth applying at all before you pay a fee.
