const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'Does an intra-company transfer need an LMIA?',
    a: 'No. It falls under the LMIA-exempt work permits, on the basis that the transfer brings a significant benefit to Canada. That removes one government decision from the sequence — it does not remove the assessment of you, your employment history, the corporate relationship, or your admissibility.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does LMIA-exempt mean this route is easier?',
    a: 'No, and treating it that way is the most common reason files fail. The evidentiary burden simply moves. Instead of an employer proving a labour shortage, you and the group have to prove a real corporate relationship, real operations on both sides, and real qualifying employment. Officers scrutinise exactly the places where the story is most often thin.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can my employer open a Canadian company so I can transfer there?',
    a: 'Opening a genuine Canadian operation as part of a real expansion is a recognised commercial step, and there is a route for transfers into a start-up operation. Incorporating a shell so that someone becomes eligible to move is not. Officers look at whether physical premises have been secured, whether the operation is realistically financed and staffed, and whether the plan is commercially credible. Where the only apparent purpose of the Canadian entity is to generate a transferee, the application does not survive that examination.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I own the foreign company. Can I transfer myself?',
    a: 'Ownership is not a bar in itself, and owner-managers do transfer. But it raises the standard of evidence considerably, because the arrangement is entirely within your control. You will need to show the foreign business genuinely operates and will continue to, that your own role there was substantive, and that the Canadian entity has a real commercial purpose beyond your relocation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What counts as specialised knowledge?',
    a: 'Knowledge that is genuinely uncommon within the industry and proprietary to that organisation — its own methods, systems, products, research or equipment — combined with an advanced level of expertise built inside the company. Ordinary professional competence, familiarity with widely used commercial software, or seniority alone do not qualify, however capable you are. It is the category IRCC gives officers the most detailed assessment instructions for, and in our own casework it is the one where files most often come apart.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long can I stay, and can it lead to permanent residence?',
    a: 'Initial permits and total maximum durations differ by category, and IRCC publishes the current limits. There is no permanent residence built into this route. Canadian work experience gained on the permit can support a separate permanent residence application later, but that is a distinct application on its own criteria — nothing about the transfer creates an entitlement.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can my spouse work and my children study?',
    a: 'Accompanying family members generally apply separately, and eligibility for an open work permit for a spouse depends on rules that IRCC revises from time to time. Check the current position before you plan around it rather than assuming what applied to someone who moved earlier still applies.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee approval?',
    a: 'No, and no one honestly can. An officer assesses the corporate relationship, your employment history and your admissibility, and that decision is not ours to make. What we can do is tell you before you spend money whether the relationship and the role are strong enough to be worth filing.',

          <p>
            Canada allows multinational employers to move key people into their Canadian operations
            without going through the labour market process, on the reasoning that transferring
            leadership and proprietary expertise into a Canadian business benefits Canada. It sits
            among the{' '}

          </p>
          <p>
            Three things have to be true at once. There must be a qualifying corporate relationship
            between the company you work for now and the company you are moving to. Both companies
            must actually be doing business. And you must already be an employee of the foreign
            company, in an executive, senior managerial or specialised-knowledge capacity, and have
            been for a qualifying period.
          </p>
          <p>
            If any one of those three fails, the route fails — regardless of how strong the other
            two are. Most of the work of preparing one of these files is proving the parts that feel
            obvious to the people inside the business and are not obvious to a visa officer reading
            it cold.

              <p>
                The two entities must be related in one of a defined set of ways. A commercial
                partnership, a franchise arrangement, a distribution agreement or a shared brand is
                not a qualifying relationship, however close the working relationship is in practice.
                What matters is ownership and control.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beyond the relationship itself, both entities must be doing business — regularly and
                continuously providing goods or services. This is the point where files most often
                come apart. A Canadian registration with no premises, no staff, no revenue and no
                trading history is not an operation; it is a registration.

              Being highly skilled is not the test. The knowledge has to be proprietary to that
              organisation and genuinely uncommon in the wider labour market, and your expertise has
              to have been built inside the company through significant and recent experience with
              it. An excellent engineer using industry-standard tools is an excellent engineer, not a

            <p>
              This is where we see files come apart. Applications describe general competence in

              named — this system, this process, this product line, developed here — the category is

          </p>
          <p>
            In practice that means the employment has to be evidenced the way real employment is
            evidenced — payroll records, tax filings, social security or provident fund records,
            bank credits of salary, appointment and promotion letters, and an organisational chart
            that places you where you say you sat. A letter from a director asserting your role,

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>A Canadian company created to enable the transfer.</strong> The most frequent one,
            and the least survivable. An entity incorporated shortly before the application, with no
            premises, no financing, no customers and no plan beyond the applicant’s arrival, reads
            exactly as what it is. Officers examine incorporation dates, leases, funding and staffing
            precisely because this pattern is well known to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A relationship that is commercial, not corporate.</strong> Long-standing partners,
            agents, distributors and franchisees are not parents, subsidiaries, branches or
            affiliates. Where the ownership documents do not show control, no amount of history
            between the businesses substitutes for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A title that outruns the duties.</strong> Retitling someone as “Director” or
            “Head of” shortly before the transfer draws attention rather than deflecting it. The
            duties, reporting lines and authority described have to be consistent with payroll,
            structure and the size of the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Employment abroad that cannot be evidenced.</strong> Undocumented family-business
            employment, cash salary, or a period on the books that does not match tax and payroll
            records. This is a common problem for applicants from Pakistan and it is worth resolving
            honestly before filing rather than being asked about it afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Specialised knowledge asserted rather than shown.</strong> Covered above, and worth
            repeating: in our experience this is the category where files are most exposed, because it
            is the one where an assertion is easiest to make and hardest to evidence.

            <strong>Assuming the permit is portable or leads somewhere.</strong> The permit is tied to
            the named employer and position, and it confers no permanent status. If your objective is

              We are asked regularly whether a company can be set up in Canada so that someone can
              transfer into it. The honest answer is that a structure assembled for the purpose of
              producing a transferee does not withstand examination, and pursuing it risks more than
              the fee — statements that misrepresent the nature of a business carry consequences for

              commonly owned, or if your role is skilled but ordinary. Skilled professionals with no
