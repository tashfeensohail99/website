  },
  {
    q: 'Someone has offered to place me in the Global Talent Stream for a fee. Is that legitimate?',
    a: 'Treat it as a serious warning sign. The employer is the applicant here, the employer carries the assessment costs, and the employer is barred from recovering those costs from the worker. An offer to sell you entry to a stream you cannot apply to is either theft, an invented employer, or a real employer being induced to breach its obligations. All three end badly for you, and misrepresentation on an immigration application carries a bar on applying again.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is a Labour Market Benefits Plan?',
    a: 'It is a written commitment by the employer, developed with ESDC, describing the lasting benefit that hiring the worker will create for Canadians and permanent residents. Each category carries a different mandatory commitment — job creation for Canadians and permanent residents in the referred category, and investment in skills and training for Canadians and permanent residents in the occupations-list category — plus additional complementary commitments with concrete activities attached to each. Progress against the plan is reviewed with ESDC afterwards.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does the employer still have to advertise the job to Canadians first?',
    a: 'The standard recruitment test that applies to most Labour Market Impact Assessments is handled differently here — the benefits plan, rather than a recruitment file, carries the obligation to Canadian workers. That is a design difference in the stream, not an absence of obligation, and ESDC sets the current expectations for each category on its own site.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How fast is it, and what does it cost?',
    a: 'We do not publish service standards or fees on this page. Both change, and a figure that is correct today becomes a liability on a page you might read next year. ESDC and IRCC publish the current fees and current service standards on their own sites. In any case the assessment fee is the employer’s to pay.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I work in technology. Does that make me eligible?',
    a: 'Not by itself. Eligibility attaches to a specific role at a specific employer, not to a profession or an industry. A senior engineer with no Canadian employer has no route here; a mid-level specialist with a referred employer and a matching role may have one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this a route to permanent residence?',
    a: 'It is a temporary work permit route. Canadian skilled work experience can matter later in permanent residence routes, but nothing about this stream converts automatically. Anyone describing it as permanent residence is describing a different thing.',

  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee me a Global Talent Stream work permit?',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            The Global Talent Stream sits inside the Temporary Foreign Worker Program. Like other{' '}
            <Link href="/work-permits/lmia" className="font-semibold text-accent-500 link-underline">

            , it produces a labour market assessment that a Canadian employer holds and that a worker
            then uses to apply for a work permit. What distinguishes it is the trade the employer makes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In place of the standard recruitment file — advertise, record who applied, explain why no
            Canadian was hired — the employer commits to a Labour Market Benefits Plan: a set of
            undertakings about what the hire will do for Canadian workers, agreed with Employment and
            Social Development Canada and reviewed afterwards. The obligation to the Canadian labour
            market does not disappear. It changes shape, from a backward-looking record into a
            forward-looking commitment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the commitment is ongoing, the employer is taking on something real. That is why
            this stream is used by companies with an actual growth plan, and why it does not behave
            like a route an intermediary can arrange on your behalf.

              A referral in the first category is a referral of a company, not of a person. An
              occupation on the list in the second category qualifies a vacancy at an employer, not a
              candidate’s CV. In both cases the assessment is about the employer and the role. You are
              assessed later, separately, by IRCC.

              This matters practically. People from Pakistan write to us describing their occupation and
              asking how to enter the stream. There is no answer to that question, because the question

            <Prose>
              <p>
                The plan is developed with ESDC rather than simply submitted to it. The employer sets
                out the lasting positive effect the hire is meant to have on the Canadian labour market
                and commits to specific activities that will produce it.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each category carries its own mandatory commitment. An employer referred as a
                high-growth company commits to creating jobs for Canadians and permanent residents. An
                employer hiring into an occupation on the published list commits to increasing its
                investment in skills and training for Canadians and permanent residents.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of the mandatory commitment, the employer agrees to further complementary
                benefits, each with concrete activities attached rather than a statement of intent.
                Progress is then reviewed with ESDC, and continued access to the stream depends on the
                employer having done what it undertook to do.

          <p>
            <strong>Paying to be “placed” in the stream.</strong> The most common and the most
            expensive. There is no worker-side application to place you into, so there is no product to
            deliver and usually no agent left to find afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating an occupation list as a personal eligibility test.</strong> Finding your
            job title on a published list tells you what an employer could hire for. It tells you
            nothing about whether any employer wants to.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Experience that does not match the role.</strong> The assessment is issued for a
            specific position. If your documented history does not credibly show you can do that
            specific job, IRCC can refuse the permit even though the employer’s side succeeded.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Documents arranged by someone else.</strong> An offer letter or experience letter
            produced by a third party, containing claims you cannot support, is misrepresentation
            whether or not you wrote it. The consequence lands on you, not on them — and if that has
            already happened, it is a matter to take to a licensed representative rather than to
            handle from a web page. We set out how we approach it on our{' '}

            <strong>Assuming speed means certainty.</strong> ESDC describes this stream as a faster route
            for employers who qualify, and publishes whatever service standard currently applies on its
            own site. Whatever that standard says, moving quickly is not the same as being likely, and it
            is not a reason to skip checking whether the employer and the role are real.

              It also tends not to suit workers whose occupation sits outside the specialised and
