    a: 'No. A substantial set of routes is exempt — intra-company transfers, certain free-trade professionals, spousal open work permits, and permits argued on significant benefit to Canada, among others.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Most Canadian work permits rest on a simple principle: a Canadian employer should hire a
            Canadian first. A Labour Market Impact Assessment — an LMIA — is the mechanism that tests
            whether that has genuinely been tried.
          </p>
          <p>
            The employer applies to Employment and Social Development Canada. ESDC assesses whether
            filling the vacancy with a foreign worker would have a neutral or positive effect on the
            Canadian labour market: whether it fills a real shortage, whether the wage matches what
            the occupation actually pays in that region, whether working conditions meet accepted
            Canadian standards, and whether the employer made reasonable efforts to hire or train
            Canadians first.
          </p>
          <p>
            Notice what is absent from that list. None of it is about you. The assessment is about the
            job and the employer. You enter the picture afterwards, at a second and separate decision
            made by a different department.

            <p>
              The regulations bind the employer directly: they must be actively engaged in the
              business, they must provide the job on the terms that were offered, they must follow the
              federal and provincial laws governing employment and recruitment, and they must not
              charge or recover the assessment fee from the worker, directly or indirectly.
            </p>
            <p>
              So an offer to sell you an LMIA for a fee is one of three things — a straightforward
              theft, an invented employer, or a real employer being induced to break the conditions
              they are legally bound by. All three end badly for you, and misrepresentation on an
              immigration application carries a bar on applying again. If someone quotes you a price
              for an LMIA, that is the moment to walk away, not to negotiate.

            <Prose>
              <p>
                The recruitment test is the heart of the assessment. In substance, the employer has to
                advertise the vacancy so that Canadians and permanent residents have a fair chance at
                it — through the channels ESDC specifies for that occupation and stream, for a minimum
                period, and at the wage the job will actually pay.
              </p>
              <p>
                They then have to account for what happened: how many Canadians applied, who was
                interviewed, and why none was hired. A recruitment record that reads as a formality
                rather than a genuine search is a common reason an assessment fails.
              </p>
              <p>
                The exact advertising channels, durations and exemptions differ by stream and by
                occupation, and they are revised periodically. ESDC publishes the current requirements
                — that is the only place to read them.

            <strong>Paying an agent for an LMIA.</strong> The pattern we are asked about most often.
            There is no product to deliver, so there is nothing to complain about later — and often no
            agent to find.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>An assessment that exists but does not fit you.</strong> A positive assessment is
            for a specific occupation. If your qualifications and work history do not credibly show you
            can do that job, IRCC can refuse the permit even though the employer’s side succeeded.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>An employer who cannot withstand scrutiny.</strong> The employer must be actively
            engaged in a real business and is subject to inspection afterwards. A shell arranged to
            produce paperwork tends to fail, and it takes your application down with it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming the permit is portable.</strong> An LMIA-based permit is normally tied to
            the named employer and occupation. People accept roles on the assumption they will switch
            employers on arrival and find that they cannot simply do so.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Documents you did not write.</strong> An offer letter or experience letter arranged
            by a third party, containing claims you cannot support, is misrepresentation whether or not
            you drafted it. The consequence lands on you.

              An LMIA-based work permit begins with a Canadian employer who already wants to hire you
              for a specific role. If you do not have one, there is no step you can take to start this
              process — and no fee you can pay to create one. Being told otherwise is what most often
              costs people money before they reach us.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also tends not to suit people whose occupation is well supplied in Canada, or whose
              documented experience does not clearly match the job title on the offer. And if you own or
              run a business, or you are self-employed, the LMIA route may be the wrong question
