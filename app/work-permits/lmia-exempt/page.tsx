    a: 'No. It means a different test, not a lower one. You skip the labour-market test, but you take on the burden of proving that the exemption applies to you — and in the discretionary categories, an officer can simply disagree with your argument. Many LMIA-exempt files are harder to build than an LMIA-backed one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I still need a job offer?',
    a: 'It depends on the family. Intra-company transfers and treaty categories are employer-specific and need an employer behind them. Owner-operator files have no third-party employer at all — you are the business. Status-based open permits need no employer.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this a permanent residence route?',
    a: 'It is a temporary work authorisation. Canadian work experience can strengthen a later permanent residence application, but a work permit does not convert into PR on its own and no one can promise you that it will. Treat them as two separate applications.',

            Not every Canadian work permit requires an employer to test the labour market. A whole
            programme sits outside it — for transfers within a company, for treaty nationals, for
            work of clear benefit to Canada, and for business owners. Exemption from the LMIA is not
            exemption from scrutiny.

          title="What the International Mobility Program is"
        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            The default rule is that a Canadian employer must first show that hiring you will not
            displace a Canadian worker. That test is the Labour Market Impact Assessment, and it is
            the employer’s application, not yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            The International Mobility Program is the set of exceptions to that rule. Parliament and
            IRCC accepted that in some situations the labour-market test makes no sense: when a
            company is moving its own senior people into its own Canadian operation, when Canada has
            promised reciprocal access under a trade agreement, when the work brings a benefit that
            outweighs any labour-market concern, or when a person’s own status — not an employer’s
            need — is the basis for working.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things follow from that, and both are easy to miss. First, an exemption is a claim
            you have to prove, and the burden sits on you rather than on an employer. Second, some of
            these categories are discretionary: the officer is not checking boxes, they are deciding
            whether they accept your argument.

          <Prose>
            <p>
              With an LMIA, an employer carries much of the evidentiary weight and the officer is
              largely reviewing a completed assessment. Without one, everything is yours to prove —
              and there is no assessment standing behind you.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the discretionary families, officers are alert to files built backwards: a shell
              company created so a transfer can be claimed, a business bought as a visa mechanism
              rather than to be run, a “benefit to Canada” asserted in general terms with nothing
              specific behind it. Officers look for exactly these patterns, and a file that shows
              them is a file in trouble.

              If you are a salaried employee looking for any Canadian employer to hire you, there is
              no exemption family that describes you — and no amount of file-building creates one.
              The same is true if you are being sold an “owner-operator” package around a business
              you have no intention of running, or a transfer from a company that exists mainly on
              paper. We will tell you this on the call rather than take your money. A refusal stays
              on your record and makes the next application harder.
