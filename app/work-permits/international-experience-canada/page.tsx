const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'Can a Pakistani passport holder apply for IEC?',
    a: 'Not through the ordinary route. IEC operates under bilateral youth mobility agreements between Canada and specific partner countries, and Canada does not have one with Pakistan. Without a partner-country passport, there is no pool for you to enter and no profile for you to create. The only openings are a second citizenship of a partner country, or support from an IRCC-recognised organisation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'AI search results and agents told me Pakistan is eligible. Why do you say otherwise?',
    a: 'Because IEC has a genuine but very narrow exception — the recognised-organisation route — summaries frequently flatten it into “Pakistan is eligible”. It is not the same thing. The ordinary IEC application, the one people mean when they say working holiday, requires a passport from a partner country. Check the partner list on IRCC’s own site before you pay anyone anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is a Recognized Organization and how is it different?',
    a: 'It is an organisation IRCC has approved to support IEC participants, typically running structured internship or exchange placements. You are selected by the organisation first, under its own criteria, and its documentation then supports your work permit application. You cannot approach IRCC directly and ask to be treated as a partner-country citizen. Places are limited, and each organisation sets its own criteria — including which nationalities and which kinds of placement it handles. IRCC publishes the list of recognised organisations; check it, and the organisation’s own terms, before assuming you qualify.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I hold Pakistani citizenship and citizenship of a partner country. What applies?',
    a: 'You would apply under the partner-country citizenship, using that country’s valid passport, and you must satisfy that specific arrangement — its age range, its conditions, and its rules on repeat participation. Dual citizenship has to be declared. What does not work is holding one passport and applying under a different country’s arrangement.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which countries does Canada have youth mobility agreements with?',
    a: 'The list changes as arrangements are signed, amended, paused or closed for a season, so we deliberately do not reproduce it here — a list on a consultancy page is out of date the moment something moves. IRCC publishes the current partner countries and territories on its own site, and that is the only version worth relying on.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the IEC working holiday the same as a Canadian work visa?',
    a: 'It results in a work permit, but the eligibility logic is completely different. Ordinary work permits turn on an employer, an occupation or an exemption category. IEC turns on nationality and age. That is precisely why it is closed to most of the world — it is a reciprocal arrangement, not a skills assessment.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you help me get onto IEC anyway?',
    a: 'No, and we will tell you that on the first call rather than take a fee to explore it. What we can do is look at whether an employer-supported permit, a study route or permanent residence is realistic for you, and say plainly if none of them is.',

          title="Why nationality decides this one"
        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Most Canadian work routes assess something about you — your employer, your occupation,
            your credentials, your experience. IEC does not work that way. It is a reciprocal
            arrangement: Canada signs a youth mobility agreement with another country, that country’s
            young people can work in Canada, and Canadian young people can work there in return.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because it is reciprocal, eligibility begins and ends with the passport you hold. Canada
            maintains agreements with a set list of partner countries and territories — published and
            revised by IRCC — and Pakistan is not among them. There is no application, appeal or fee
            that changes that. It is a decision made between two governments, not a criterion you can
            meet.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters because IEC is widely written about in a way that makes it sound open to
            everyone. It is a genuinely good arrangement — an open work permit, no employer required,
            no labour market assessment. That is exactly why it is worth being clear that, for a
            Pakistani passport holder without a second nationality, it is not available.

            <p>
              A recognised organisation is approved by IRCC to support IEC participants. Some of them
              run placement, internship and exchange programmes that are open to citizens of
              countries with no agreement of their own. What each organisation offers, and which
              nationalities and fields it will consider, differs from one organisation to the next and
              is set by that organisation — so the only reliable answer comes from IRCC’s published
              list and from the organisation itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              The important structural point is the order of events. You are accepted by the
              organisation first, under its own criteria and within its own capacity, and its letter
              of support is then included in a work permit application to IRCC. You cannot instruct a
              consultant to place you with one. If a place does not exist, the route does not exist
              either.

          <p>
            <strong>Paying for an “IEC visa”.</strong> The most common one. Because IEC is genuinely
            attractive and genuinely well known, it is an easy thing to sell. There is no product to
            deliver, and no application was ever filed.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Trusting an AI summary or a forum post.</strong> The recognised-organisation
            exception is real, so a search result can point to something technically accurate while
            leaving the reader with a completely wrong impression of what is available to them.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Applying under a passport you do not hold.</strong> A residence permit, a work
            visa or long residence in a partner country is not citizenship of it. Only a passport from
            a partner country opens the ordinary route.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Being sold a fake partner-country connection.</strong> Anything that involves
            documents suggesting a nationality or status you do not have risks a finding of
            misrepresentation, and the consequences of such a finding follow you long after the agent
            is gone. If you are worried you have already signed something like this,{' '}
