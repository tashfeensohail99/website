const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'What actually is an LMIA?',
    a: 'A Labour Market Impact Assessment is a decision by Employment and Social Development Canada on whether hiring a foreign worker for a specific job would help, harm, or have no effect on the Canadian labour market. The employer applies for it, advertises the role, and has to show they tried to fill it locally. It exists to protect Canadian workers — it is not a document about you, and it is not something you can obtain yourself.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I buy an LMIA or a job offer?',
    a: 'No. Selling a job offer or an LMIA position is illegal in Canada, and paying for one puts you on the wrong side of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act as well. Employers are also barred from recovering LMIA or recruitment costs from the worker — ESDC sets that out in the Temporary Foreign Worker Program requirements on canada.ca. Submitting a purchased or fabricated offer is misrepresentation, which carries a bar on entering Canada in addition to the refusal; IRCC publishes the current bar period on its inadmissibility pages. If someone in Pakistan is quoting you a price for an LMIA, that is the scam, not a shortcut.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between an open and an employer-specific permit?',
    a: 'An employer-specific permit names one employer and usually one location and occupation; you cannot lawfully work elsewhere on it, and changing jobs means a new application. An open permit lets you work for most employers. Open permits are not applied for on their own merits — they exist only in defined categories, most of which derive from someone else’s status or from study in Canada.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does an LMIA-exempt permit mean it is easier?',
    a: 'No. It means the labour-market test is skipped because the category itself is considered to benefit Canada. The evidentiary burden simply moves onto you — you have to prove the category applies, which for something like a significant-benefit case means building and defending a genuine business argument.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much are the fees, and how long does it take?',
    a: 'We do not publish either on this page, because both change and a stale number on a website is worse than no number. IRCC publishes current fees and processing times on canada.ca, and they are the only reliable source for them. Our own professional fee is quoted in writing for your specific file before you commit to anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a work permit lead to permanent residence?',
    a: 'Not automatically. They are separate applications under separate rules. Canadian work experience can strengthen some permanent-residence routes, but no work permit converts into PR on its own, and anyone telling you otherwise is selling you something.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I have been refused before. Is that fatal?',
    a: 'Usually not, but it changes how the file has to be built. What matters is why you were refused and whether the underlying problem has been addressed. What is fatal is hiding it — a previous refusal you did not disclose is far more damaging than the refusal itself.',

          <p>
            A Labour Market Impact Assessment is a decision made by Employment and Social Development
            Canada about a job, not about a person. The employer applies. The employer advertises the
            role in Canada, documents that recruitment effort, and asks for a ruling on whether
            hiring a foreign worker for that position would have a positive, neutral or negative
            effect on the Canadian labour market.
          </p>
          <p>
            It exists for one reason: to protect the Canadian labour market. That framing explains
            almost everything that frustrates applicants about it. The employer bears the cost and
            the paperwork, so employers only do it when they genuinely cannot fill a role. It cannot
            be initiated by you. It is issued for a particular position at a particular business, so
            it is not portable and not a personal asset. And it is not a work permit — a positive
            LMIA is evidence you then use in your own application to IRCC, which is decided
            separately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Government fees, wage requirements and processing times attached to the LMIA process are
            set by Employment and Social Development Canada and IRCC and are revised from time to
            time. We do not reproduce them here, because a stale figure on a website is worse than no
            figure. Check them at the source: ESDC publishes the employer requirements and the LMIA

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            The offer sounds reasonable at first. Someone will arrange a Canadian job offer for you,
            or an LMIA position with a real company, for a fee — often a very large one, sometimes
            staged across payments, sometimes with a photograph of an approval letter as proof. The
            company name may even be genuine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Selling a job offer or an LMIA position is illegal in Canada. That is not a technicality
            about the seller’s conduct that leaves you clean. When you submit that offer to IRCC, you
            are the one submitting it. If the offer is fabricated, or the job does not really exist,
            or you paid for a position that was never advertised in good faith, that is
            misrepresentation under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
          </p>
          <p>
            The consequence is not simply a refusal. A misrepresentation finding carries a bar on
            entering Canada that runs for years, attaches to you personally, and follows you into
            every future application — including ones you would otherwise have qualified for
            honestly. The bar period is set by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and stated
            by IRCC at{' '}

            ; read it there rather than take our word or anyone else’s for the length. People lose the study permit, the visit visa and the spouse’s application too.
            Meanwhile the money is gone and there is no one to recover it from, because you paid a
            person in Pakistan for an illegal act in Canada.
          </p>
          <p>The signals are consistent and worth memorising:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You are asked to pay for a job offer, an LMIA, or a &ldquo;position&rdquo;. Legitimate
              Canadian employers do not charge you to hire you.
            </li>
            <li>
              An LMIA number or approval letter is shown to you as proof, but you are not put in
              direct contact with the employer.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is no interview, or an interview so cursory that the employer plainly does not
              care whether you can do the job.
            </li>
            <li>
              Payment is requested in cash, to a personal account, or through a third country, and
              nothing is put in writing.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are told the permit or permanent residence is guaranteed. Nobody can guarantee an
              officer’s decision.
            </li>
            <li>
              You are advised to leave a previous refusal, a previous name, or a relative in Canada
              off the forms.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you are already in one of these arrangements, stop before anything is filed. A
            situation you have not yet submitted is recoverable. A misrepresentation finding largely
            is not.
