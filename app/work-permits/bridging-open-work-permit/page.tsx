/**
 * Bridging open work permit (BOWP).
 *
 * This page exists to prevent one specific, expensive mistake: letting a work
 * permit run out while a permanent residence application is in the queue. The
 * BOWP is a narrow, conditional bridge — not a general extension — and the
 * window to use it is defined by the expiry of the permit you already hold.
 * Everything here is structural. No fees, no processing times, no thresholds.

const FAQS = [
  {
    q: 'What does a bridging open work permit actually do?',
    a: 'It closes a gap. Permanent residence applications take longer to decide than a work permit lasts, so applicants who are already working in Canada can be left with a valid PR application and no right to work. The bridging permit lets certain applicants keep working while that application is decided, instead of losing their job or their status in the interval.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which permanent residence applicants does it cover?',
    a: 'As a category, it is aimed at economic-class applicants — the federal Express Entry programs, provincial nominee applicants, Quebec’s own economic selection, and a rotating set of federal pilots. It is not a general measure for every route to permanent residence: family class and humanitarian applicants are dealt with under different rules. We deliberately do not publish the list of covered classes here. Pilots open and close, classes are added and removed, and each class has its own stage requirement, so a list copied onto a law-firm page ages badly. Check your own class against IRCC’s current page for this permit rather than against any summary, including this one.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I have a provincial nomination. Am I automatically eligible for an open permit?',
    a: 'Not automatically, and the distinction is sharper than most people expect. What matters is whether your nomination carries an employment restriction, not merely whether it names an employer or an occupation — a nomination can name both and still impose no restriction. Where the province has imposed an employment restriction, the open permit is generally not the available route at all; a separate employer-specific bridging permit is, and that has its own preconditions on the employer’s side. Read the wording of your own nomination letter before assuming you can change jobs.',
  },
  {
    q: 'When exactly should I apply?',
    a: 'Relative to your current permit’s expiry, inside the window IRCC publishes. Applying far too early tends to result in refusal as premature; applying after your permit has already expired means there is nothing left to bridge. The safe practice is to diarise your expiry date the day you receive your permit and take advice well before the window opens.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if I let my permit expire first?',
    a: 'You lose the ability to keep working, and you are out of status. Restoration of status exists but is discretionary, time-limited and not a substitute for filing on time — and in the meantime you cannot work. It is one of the more damaging and most avoidable outcomes we see.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does the bridging permit improve my chances of permanent residence?',
    a: 'No. It has no bearing on the PR decision. It preserves your ability to work while that decision is made, nothing more. If the permanent residence application is refused, the bridge does not survive the refusal.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can my spouse work while I hold a bridging permit?',
    a: 'A spouse’s ability to work depends on their own eligibility for an open work permit, which turns on your occupation and status rather than on the bridging permit itself. It is a separate application with separate requirements — see our page on spousal open work permits.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I apply for a bridging permit from Pakistan?',
    a: 'No. This is an in-Canada measure for people who already hold a work permit here. If you are in Pakistan and have not yet worked in Canada, the relevant conversation is about the underlying work permit or permanent residence route, not about bridging.',

          title="What a bridging open work permit is for"
        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Permanent residence is not decided overnight. A person can be working lawfully in Canada,
            file a well-prepared economic-class application, and still watch their work permit run out
            long before a decision is made. Without a remedy, that person stops being allowed to work —
            through no fault of theirs and while their own application is sitting in the queue.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bridging open work permit is that remedy. It allows certain permanent residence
            applicants who are already in Canada on a work permit to apply for a further permit that
            carries them through to the decision. In most cases it is open, meaning it is not tied to a
            single named employer, though there are situations where the permit that follows is
            employer-specific instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things are worth being blunt about. First, it is a bridge and nothing more — it does not
            advance, strengthen or accelerate the permanent residence application underneath it.
            Second, it is not a general safety net. It covers particular classes of applicant, at a
            particular stage, within a particular window. Falling outside any of those means it does not
            apply to you.

              Almost every serious problem with this route reduces to timing. The right to apply is
              defined by reference to when your current permit expires, and the protection that lets you
              keep working while the new application is assessed depends on having filed before that
              expiry — not after it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Miss it and the consequences are immediate and real: you must stop working, your employer
              must stop employing you, and you are relying on a discretionary restoration process that
              nobody should plan around. Treat the expiry date on your permit as a hard deadline you work
              backwards from, not a date you notice when it arrives.

          <p>
            <strong>Applying after the permit has already expired.</strong> The single most damaging
            error, and the least recoverable. Once expiry has passed there is no bridge, only a
            discretionary restoration process during which you cannot work.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Applying before the bridge has opened.</strong> Filing the moment the permanent
            residence application goes in, before it has reached the stage IRCC requires, tends to
            produce a refusal — and refusals consume time you may not have.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming a nomination means an open permit.</strong> Where the nomination carries an
            employment restriction, the route is a separate employer-specific permit rather than the open
            one, and it needs steps taken by the employer. People resign in anticipation of portability
            they do not have.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Confusing this with a permit extension on the same basis.</strong> A bridging permit
            depends on a live permanent residence application at the right stage. If your PR application
            is not there yet, a different extension route may be the correct one — or there may be none.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Travelling at the wrong moment.</strong> Leaving Canada while an in-Canada extension
            is pending can complicate both your re-entry and the application. Take advice before booking,
            not after.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Letting the employer discover the problem first.</strong> Employers stop payroll when
            work authorisation lapses. Tell your employer your expiry date early so nobody is improvising
            in the last week.
