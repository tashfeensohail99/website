 * used to be close to that. It no longer is, and the narrowing is the single

  {
    q: 'What does “open” actually mean?',
    a: 'It means the permit is not tied to a single named employer. You may generally work for most employers in Canada, change jobs without a new permit, and hold more than one job. That is a genuinely different thing from an employer-specific permit, where leaving the named employer means your authorisation to work stops. Open does not mean unrestricted — some occupations require additional medical clearance, and an open permit does not by itself satisfy provincial licensing for regulated professions.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My spouse has a Canadian work permit. Do I automatically get one?',
    a: 'No, and this is the assumption that causes the most disappointment. Eligibility now turns on which occupation your spouse works in, not merely on the fact that they hold a permit. IRCC publishes the qualifying set and it has been narrowed. Check it against your spouse’s actual occupation before you make plans that depend on two incomes.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My spouse is studying in Canada. Does that qualify me?',
    a: 'Only for certain levels and types of programme. Enrolment at a designated learning institution is not enough on its own any more. IRCC publishes which programmes count. Because this is exactly the kind of rule that is revised, treat any list you read elsewhere — including on a consultant’s page — as out of date until you have confirmed it at the source.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens to my permit when my spouse’s status ends?',
    a: 'A spousal open work permit is derivative. It is normally issued to align with the principal’s status and it does not survive independently of it. If their permit expires, is not extended, or their status is lost, yours is affected. Plan extensions as a pair, well before expiry, not separately and not late.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I work while my inland spousal sponsorship is being processed?',
    a: 'There is a route that allows a spouse or partner being sponsored from inside Canada to work while the permanent residence application is decided, so that the family is not left without income for the length of the process. It has its own conditions — including requirements about the applicant’s status in Canada and about the sponsorship application having reached a certain point with IRCC — and there are separate arrangements for people whose status has lapsed. IRCC sets those conditions out on its own page for an open work permit in Canada for a sponsored spouse or partner; read them there rather than relying on a summary. Our spouse and partner sponsorship page covers how the underlying application works.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does having an open work permit help my permanent residence application?',
    a: 'Indirectly at most. Canadian work experience gained on an open permit can matter for some economic routes, and holding one keeps a family together while another application proceeds. But the permit itself is temporary status. It is not a step in a permanent residence process and it does not become permanent residence by the passage of time.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What are the current fees and processing times?',
    a: 'IRCC publishes both, and both change. We do not print them here, because a figure that is accurate today is a liability on a page you might read next year. Use IRCC’s own fee list and its check-processing-times tool on canada.ca, on the day you apply. The links are in the sources section above.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee my spouse’s permit?',
    a: 'No, and no one honestly can. The decision belongs to a visa officer. What we can tell you, before you spend anything, is whether your spouse’s occupation or programme falls inside the current criteria at all — which is often the whole answer.',

          title="What an open work permit is, and is not"
        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            Most Canadian work permits name an employer. The permit authorises you to work for that
            employer, in that occupation, and if you leave, your authorisation to work goes with the
            job. An open work permit is different in kind: it is not tied to a named employer, so the
            holder can work for most employers, change jobs, and hold more than one at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            That difference matters enormously to families. It is the difference between a spouse who
            can take whatever work they find and a spouse who cannot lawfully work at all. It is also
            why the spousal open work permit was, for many years, the quiet reason a study or work
            plan in Canada added up financially.
          </p>
          <p>
            The important change is this. Eligibility used to follow fairly broadly from the
            principal applicant simply holding a study or work permit. It no longer does. For spouses
            of workers, it now depends on the occupation the worker holds. For spouses of students,
            it depends on the level and type of programme. Both qualifying sets have been reduced,
            and both are published and revised by IRCC.
          </p>
          <p>
            We deliberately do not reproduce those lists here. They are precisely the detail that
            changes, and a stale list on a consultant’s page is how families end up planning around a
            second income that was never going to be authorised.

          <Callout title="Check the principal, not the spouse">
            <p>
              The instinct is to ask whether the spouse qualifies. That is the wrong question. In
              almost every case the answer is determined by the principal applicant — what occupation
              the worker is employed in, or what programme the student is enrolled in, and how much
              validity remains on their own permit.
            </p>
            <p>
              So the first thing to establish is not your own profile but theirs, measured against
              what IRCC currently publishes. If the principal falls outside the criteria, no amount of
              strengthening the spouse’s file changes the outcome.

            <Prose>
              <p>
                The first question is eligibility: does the principal applicant’s occupation or
                programme fall inside the current criteria, and does their status have enough
                remaining validity. This is largely mechanical. Either it fits or it does not.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second question is the relationship: is the marriage or common-law partnership
                genuine. This is a judgement, and it is where files from Pakistan most often run into
                difficulty — not because relationships are less genuine here, but because arranged
                marriages, short courtships and limited cohabitation before the wedding produce a
                documentary record that officers read as thin.
              </p>
              <p>
                The answer is not to manufacture evidence. It is to explain the record you actually
                have, in the cultural terms that make it coherent, and to submit what genuinely exists
                rather than a template someone else assembled.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            <strong>Budgeting on two incomes before checking eligibility.</strong> A family commits to
            tuition and living costs on the assumption the spouse will work, then discovers the
            principal’s programme or occupation does not qualify. By then the money is spent and the
            plan has no slack in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Relying on a rule that has since changed.</strong> Advice from a cousin who moved
            three years ago, or a page that was accurate when it was written, describes a set of
            criteria that no longer applies. This route has been narrowed. Old accounts of it are
            confidently wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A thin relationship record.</strong> Where the wedding was recent and the couple
            has not lived together, the file can contain almost nothing beyond a certificate.
            Explaining that honestly, with what does exist, does better than padding it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Documents arranged by a third party.</strong> Photographs, chat logs or affidavits
            assembled to fit an expectation rather than to reflect what happened. If it is found to be
            constructed, the finding is misrepresentation and it lands on you — with a bar on future
            applications. See{' '}

          <p>
            <strong>Leaving the extension too late.</strong> The permit is aligned to the principal’s
            status. When theirs is extended, yours is not extended with it automatically. Families
            treat the two as one thing and lose work authorisation in the gap.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Assuming an open permit means any job.</strong> Regulated professions still
            require provincial licensing, and some work involving healthcare or children requires
            additional medical clearance. Open means not employer-specific — not unconditional.
