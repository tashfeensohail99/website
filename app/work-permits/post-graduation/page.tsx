/**
 * Post-graduation work permit.
 *
 * The job of this page is to move one belief: that "studying in Canada" earns
 * a work permit. It does not. Eligibility attaches to the institution AND the
 * specific programme, and the permit is once in a lifetime — so the decision
 * that matters is the one made before enrolment, not after graduation.
 *
 * Deliberately no durations, no field-of-study lists, no language benchmarks,
 * no application windows. All of those are revised and all of them are on IRCC.

  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get a second one after another course?',
    a: 'No. It is a once-in-a-lifetime permit. Completing a second programme in Canada does not produce a second post-graduation work permit. This is the single most consequential fact on this page, because it means the permit has to be planned for before the first enrolment, not after it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My college is on the designated learning institution list. Am I covered?',
    a: 'Not necessarily. Appearing on the designated list means the school may host international students. Whether its graduates can be considered for this permit is a separate question, and whether your particular programme qualifies is a third. All three have to be satisfied. Verify each one against IRCC before you enrol.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does my field of study matter?',
    a: 'It depends on the credential, not on you. For some levels of qualification the field of study is not assessed at all; for others the programme must fall within the fields IRCC accepts, and which programmes those are is reviewed and republished. It also depends on when you applied for your study permit, because the requirement was introduced part-way through and applicants before that point are treated differently. Which side of that line you fall on is the thing to establish first — check it against IRCC’s current field-of-study page rather than against advice given to a friend in a different intake year.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the permit tied to one employer?',
    a: 'No. It is an open work permit, so it is not tied to a named employer or occupation, though a small number of employers are off-limits to open work permit holders and IRCC maintains that list. That openness is what makes it valuable — it lets you take the Canadian work experience that several permanent residence routes are built around.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does the permit lead to permanent residence?',
    a: 'Not by itself. It is a bridge, not a destination. What it gives you is time and authorisation to gain skilled Canadian work experience, which several federal and provincial routes weigh heavily. Whether that converts depends on the work you actually get, your language results and your wider profile.',
  },
  {
    q: 'I studied online from Pakistan. Does that time count?',
    a: 'It depends on when the study took place and under which policy. Rules on distance and online learning have changed more than once, and time spent studying outside Canada is treated differently from time spent in Canada. This needs to be checked against the policy in force for your specific period of study.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee I will get one after I graduate?',
    a: 'No. Eligibility depends on decisions made by your institution, by policy, and by an officer, and none of those are ours. What we can do — and what actually helps — is check the institution and the programme against the current rules before you commit money to a course.',

        />
        <Prose>
          <p>
            A post-graduation work permit is an open work permit granted to certain international
            graduates of certain Canadian institutions. Open means it is not tied to a named employer
            or a named occupation: you can work for almost any employer, change jobs, and take the
            role you can actually get rather than the one written on a piece of paper before you
            arrived.
          </p>
          <p>
            That openness is the whole point. Several routes to permanent residence — federal and
            provincial — are built around skilled work experience gained in Canada. The permit is what
            buys you the authorisation and the time to accumulate it. It is a bridge between finishing
            a course and having something an immigration route can weigh.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also, and this is the part that surprises people, granted once. Not once per
            qualification, not once per institution. Once. A second diploma does not produce a second
            permit. Every decision about where and what to study should be made with that in mind.

              Being a designated learning institution means a school is approved to host international
              students. It does not, on its own, mean its graduates can be considered for this permit,
              and it says nothing at all about whether your particular programme qualifies. These are
              three different questions with three different answers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recruiters have sold courses on the strength of the first question alone. Students have
              completed those courses, applied, and been refused — with the tuition spent, the years
              gone, and no second attempt available, because the permit is once in a lifetime. Get
              confirmation on all three points, in writing, before you pay a deposit.

              <p>
                The permit’s validity is tied to the length of the programme you finished, subject to a
                maximum. A longer programme produces a longer permit, up to that ceiling; a short
                programme produces a short one, and below a certain length no permit at all.
              </p>
              <p>
                This matters more than it looks. Permanent residence routes that value Canadian work
                experience generally want a meaningful period of it, and that period has to fit inside
                the permit you were granted. A permit that expires before you have accumulated what a
                route requires leaves you with the experience but not the status — which is a bad place
                to be, and a common one.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bands, the ceiling, and the treatment of particular levels of study are set by
                policy and have been revised. IRCC publishes the current position, and that is where
                the number should come from — on the day you need it, for your own programme.

            <strong>Choosing the course on a recruiter’s word.</strong> The commission is paid on
            enrolment, not on your permit. We have sat with graduates who were told a programme
            qualified, kept no written confirmation, and had no recourse once the refusal arrived.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Enrolling on rules that applied to someone else.</strong> Eligibility depends in
            part on when you applied for your study permit, because requirements were phased in. A
            cousin who graduated from the same college two intakes earlier may have been assessed under
            a different rule entirely. Their outcome tells you nothing about yours.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Breaking status mid-course.</strong> Dropping to part-time without authorisation,
            letting a study permit lapse, or taking an unapproved break can disqualify a graduate who is
            otherwise fine on every other test. It is discovered at the end, when it cannot be repaired.

          <p>
            <strong>Leaving the language test until the application.</strong> The test is now part of
            the application and results have a validity period. Booking dates in Pakistan and in Canada
            are not always available at short notice, and the application window after graduation is not
            generous.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Spending the permit on work that does not count.</strong> The permit is open, so any
            job is lawful — but not every job builds the kind of experience a permanent residence route
            weighs. People work for the full validity of the permit and reach the end with nothing a

              This route does not suit someone who does not actually want the qualification. Study in
              Canada is expensive, it takes years, and the permit at the end is conditional on the
              institution, the programme, your status throughout and a language result. If the course
              itself has no value to you, you are paying a great deal for a permit you may not receive.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also tends not to suit people who already hold strong skilled experience and good
              language results — for them, applying directly through an economic route is often faster
              and cheaper than spending years and tuition to arrive at the same starting line. And it
              does not suit anyone whose plan depends on a short, low-cost programme, since below a
              certain programme length no permit is issued at all.

            Permit durations, the list of eligible fields of study, the language levels and accepted
            tests, and the window for applying are all set by policy and reviewed. We deliberately do
            not publish those figures here, because a figure that is correct today is a liability on a
            page you might read in two years — and this is a permit you only get one attempt at.
