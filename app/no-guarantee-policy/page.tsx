/**
 * The most important page on the site, and the one every competitor refuses to
 * write.
 *
 * It is linked from the footer of every page — so it must exist, and it must say
 * the thing plainly. Every immigration regulator prohibits guaranteeing outcomes;
 * the entire Pakistani market advertises the opposite. Stating the rule clearly,
 * and telling people how to check anyone who breaks it, is simultaneously the
 * legally required position, the strongest trust signal available, and a filter
 * that pushes unqualified traffic away before it reaches the sales team.
 *
 * Attack the CLAIM, never a named firm — naming competitors invites defamation
 * exposure and breaches legal-marketing rules, and it isn't necessary: the reader
 * does the identification themselves.
