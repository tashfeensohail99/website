        Some rounds of invitations are not open to the whole pool. IRCC selects a targeted group
        first — for example, candidates with work experience in a named occupational field, or strong
        French — and then invites from the top of that filtered group. It can favour people a general
        round would never reach. The categories are set by ministerial instruction and are revised,

        Yes — it is the largest single addition available to a CRS score, and in practice the most

        itself, which is still assessed on its merits. A nomination is also competitive in its own
        right, with its own streams and criteria, and it is not something you can simply choose to

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Express Entry is an intake and management system run by IRCC. It does not have its own
            eligibility criteria and it does not grant permanent residence. What it does is hold
            candidates who already qualify for one of three federal economic programmes, rank them
            against each other, and periodically invite the highest-ranked to apply.
          </p>
          <p>
            So the question “do I qualify for Express Entry?” is really two questions. First: do I
            meet the requirements of one of the three programmes it manages? If not, there is no pool
            to enter. Second: if I do qualify, does my ranking realistically reach an invitation? A
            profile can be perfectly valid and still never be invited. Both questions have to be
            answered honestly, and the second one is the one people skip.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything else — the profile, the CRS score, the rounds of invitations, the category
            draws — is machinery sitting on top of those two questions.

              an officer expects is a weak claim, whatever the reality of your career. That evidence

                The Comprehensive Ranking System scores your profile and ranks it against everyone
                else in the pool. Broadly it rewards being younger, more educated, more proficient in
                English or French, and more experienced — plus specific additional factors such as a
                provincial nomination, French ability, a sibling in Canada, or study completed in
                Canada. We don’t reproduce the points table here — IRCC maintains it and revises it,

              </p>
              <p>
                It is a relative ranking, not a pass mark. Your score doesn’t need to be “good”; it
                needs to be higher than most of the pool on the day a round runs. That is why a score
                that was competitive once may not be later, without anything about you changing.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some factors you can move — a better language result is usually the fastest and
                cheapest lever, and often the only one. Age moves against you every year. Being clear
                about which of your factors can actually change is the whole of a realistic plan.

                IRCC runs two kinds of rounds. A general round invites from the top of the whole pool.
                A category-based round first narrows the pool to a targeted group set by ministerial
                instruction, then invites from the top of that group.
              </p>
              <p>
                Categories have covered things like strong French-language ability and work experience
                in named occupational fields — healthcare and social services, trades, education,
                STEM, transport — and the list is revised as Canada’s labour needs change. Because
                the filtered group is smaller, a category round can reach candidates a general round
                would not.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two honest cautions. Being in a targeted field usually still means meeting a defined
                work-experience requirement in a qualifying occupation, not simply working in the
                sector. And categories are policy, not entitlement — they can be added, changed or
                dropped, so a plan that only works if a particular category keeps running is fragile.
