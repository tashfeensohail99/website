        No. Eligibility is one thing; an invitation from the pool is another, and the final decision
        belongs to an IRCC officer. What we can do is confirm honestly whether your Canadian
        experience qualifies, and file a case that stands up.{' '}

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Every occupation in the National Occupational Classification carries a TEER category —
            a measure of the training, education, experience and responsibility the job involves.
            TEER 0 and TEER 1 cover management and professional roles. TEER 2 and TEER 3 cover
            technical occupations and the skilled trades.
          </p>
          <p>
            CEC sets a higher language benchmark for TEER 0 and TEER 1 work than for TEER 2 and
            TEER 3 work. The benchmark is expressed in Canadian Language Benchmarks and it applies
            separately to each of the four abilities — speaking, listening, reading and writing.
            Meeting it on average is not meeting it. One weak ability makes you ineligible even
            where the other three are comfortable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things follow. First, your NOC code is not cosmetic: it decides which bar you have
            to clear, and it is assigned on the duties you genuinely performed rather than on the
            title printed on your contract. Second, your test result has to still be valid on the
            day you apply, which makes when you sit it a real planning decision.{' '}
