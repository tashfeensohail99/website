/**
 * Category-based selection in Express Entry.
 *
 * The point people misunderstand: a category is not a programme you apply to.
 * It is a filter IRCC applies to the existing pool. You either fall inside the
 * definition or you do not — you cannot pick one, and you cannot be placed in one.
 * We deliberately name no current category and no cut-off score, and we do not assert what a
 * category may be based on — IRPA leaves the criteria to the Minister. Everything current is
 * linked out to IRCC. Do not reintroduce category names, cut-offs, or occupation lists here.

You either fall inside that definition or you do not. If your work history genuinely sits in a named field, the useful work is making sure your profile and supporting documents describe it accurately — not asking to be moved into a category.',

    q: 'Which categories are open right now?',
    a: 'We do not publish the list here. Categories are established by the Minister and can be added, changed or dropped, and the occupations inside a category can be revised. IRCC maintains the current list on its category-based selection page, which is the only place to read it on the day you need it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a category round always have a lower cut-off than a general round?',
    a: 'Not necessarily, and it is a mistake to plan on it. A category round draws from a smaller group, which can mean a different cut-off, but it depends entirely on how many eligible candidates are sitting in that group and how many invitations are issued — neither of which is knowable in advance. A category can be narrow and still be crowded with well-scored candidates. IRCC publishes the outcome of every round, including the category and the cut-off, on its rounds-of-invitations page; that record is the only honest guide, and past rounds do not commit the department to anything. Treat category eligibility as a possible additional route to an invitation, not as a discount.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How are categories decided?',
    a: 'The legislation requires the Minister to set out, in the instruction, the economic goal the category is meant to support, and to run a public consultation process with stakeholders — provinces and territories, industry, unions, employers, workers and worker advocacy groups, settlement provider organisations, and immigration researchers and practitioners. A report listing the categories, the selection criteria and the process applied must then be tabled before Parliament. It is a policy instrument that is reviewed and revised, not a fixed part of the programme. IRCC describes the current process, and publishes the consultation and parliamentary reports, on its own site.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is French-language ability worth pursuing for this?',
    a: 'Only if you would genuinely reach a usable standard. Official-language ability is assessed by a designated test across all four abilities — reading, writing, listening and speaking — and IRCC publishes which tests it accepts and the minimum result any given category requires. Reaching that level from a standing start is a serious undertaking, not a short course, and how long it takes depends entirely on you; nobody can promise you a timeline. Ability in a second official language can also raise your ranking score independently of any category. If you already speak French, get tested. If you do not, be honest with yourself about the commitment before you build a plan on it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a category invitation give me a different or faster status?',
    a: 'No. The invitation is to apply under the same programme you were already eligible for. Nothing about the application, the assessment or the resulting status differs because the invitation came from a category round.',
  },
  {
    q: 'My occupation was in a category last year. Does that carry over?',
    a: 'It does not carry a guarantee. Categories are set for a period and reviewed, and the occupations inside a category can be revised when it is. A profile that qualified in one cycle may not in the next, and no one can tell you in advance which way that will go.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee me an invitation through a category?',
    a: 'No. Whether a category exists, whether a round is held under it, how many invitations are issued and where the cut-off falls are all decisions we have no part in. We can tell you honestly whether your documented history plausibly meets a category definition, and what it would take to evidence it.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Express Entry is a pool. Candidates who are eligible for one of the federal economic
            programmes submit a profile, receive a Comprehensive Ranking System score, and wait. In a
            general round, the department sets a number of invitations and issues them to the
            highest-ranked candidates. Your score is the only thing that decides whether you are in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Category-based selection sits on top of that. Amendments to the{' '}
            <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</em> allow the Minister to establish
            categories of candidates and to run rounds that invite from within a category rather than
            from the pool at large. The Act does not restrict what a category may be built on: it
            leaves the Minister to set the eligibility criteria, subject to the conditions described
            further down this page. In practice categories have been framed around things like work
            experience and official-language ability, but the basis, the definitions and the list
            itself are all revisable — read the current criteria on IRCC’s{' '}

          <p>
            The practical consequence is straightforward. If your profile falls inside a category
            being drawn from, you are competing against a smaller group. If it does not, category
            rounds are simply not events that concern you, and your plan has to rest on your score,

              This is the single point people get wrong. There is no box to tick, no category to
              request, and no one who can place you inside one. IRCC assesses whether the profile you
              submitted meets a category’s definition. If your work history is in the field, it is; if
              it is not, no filing strategy changes that.

                to raise the score: retake the language test, add a credential, secure a provincial
                nomination.
              </p>
              <p>
                Category-based selection adds a second question that is worth asking first, because it
                costs nothing to answer. Does your existing work history already place you inside a
                field the Minister has named? If so, the smaller comparison group may matter more than
                the extra points you were planning to chase.
              </p>
              <p>
                It does not replace score-building. It reorders it. Confirm whether a category
                plausibly applies to you before you spend money on a strategy built entirely around
                raising a number.

            Categories are not written into the immigration regulations and are not permanent. The
            Minister establishes them by instruction, and the legislation imposes conditions on doing
            so: the instruction must state the economic goal the category is meant to support, and
            the Minister must consult before establishing one — provinces and territories, industry
            bodies, unions, employers, worker representatives, settlement organisations, and
            researchers and practitioners.
