  {
    q: 'Do I need a job offer?',
    a: 'Not necessarily — you need either a qualifying Canadian job offer or a certificate of qualification issued by a Canadian province or territory. One or the other. Most applicants outside Canada find the job offer easier to picture and the certificate harder to obtain, which is exactly why this programme stays small.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get a provincial certificate of qualification from Pakistan?',
    a: 'Sometimes, and sometimes not. Each province sets its own process for assessing a foreign-trained tradesperson, and some require you to write a challenge exam or work in the trade in Canada before they will certify you. It has to be checked province by province, for your trade, before you rely on it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is the English requirement really lower?',
    a: 'It is lower than the Federal Skilled Worker Program, yes — but it is set separately for each ability rather than as one overall score, and the speaking and listening standard is higher than the reading and writing one. A candidate with a strong academic reading score and weak spoken English can fail here while passing elsewhere. IRCC publishes the current thresholds on its site.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does a trade diploma count instead of experience?',
    a: 'No. This programme is built on work experience in the trade, done by you, recently. Education can help your ranking score once you are in the pool, but it does not substitute for having practised the trade.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How many people actually come through this programme?',
    a: 'Comparatively few. It is the narrowest of the three federal Express Entry programmes, and rounds of invitations aimed at it alone are occasional rather than routine. Many tradespeople who do get invited come in through other paths — category-based rounds aimed at trade occupations, or a provincial nomination. IRCC publishes the full record of rounds of invitations on canada.ca, so you can check the pattern yourself rather than take our word for it.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What will it cost me?',
    a: 'Two separate things: our professional fee, and government fees paid to IRCC (not to us). Provincial certification and language testing carry their own charges as well. Government fees change, so we do not print them here — IRCC publishes its current fee list on canada.ca. Our own fees are set out on our fees page and itemised in writing before you sign anything.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How long does it take?',
    a: 'It depends on your case, on the province if you go the certification route, and on IRCC. Anyone quoting you a fixed date is guessing. We will give you an honest range once we have seen your file.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee it?',
    a: 'No — and neither can anyone else. An IRCC officer decides your application, and no consultant can overrule that. What we can do is tell you plainly whether your case is worth filing.',

              <p>
                Trades in Canada are regulated primarily by the provinces and territories. A
                certificate of qualification is that authority’s formal statement that you are
                qualified to practise your trade there — it is issued by the body that governs the
                trade in a province or territory, or in some cases by a federal authority, and the
                immigration programme simply recognises it.
              </p>
              <p>
                That means the process, the paperwork and the standard differ by province and by
                trade. Some assess your foreign experience on paper. Some require you to sit a
                challenge exam. Some expect a period of supervised work in Canada before they will
                certify you at all — which is a genuine obstacle if you have never been to Canada.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is worth knowing that some trades are compulsory — you may not legally work in
                them without certification — while others are voluntary. Which is which depends on
                the province.

            <Prose>
              <p>
                The alternative is a genuine offer of full-time employment in your skilled trade
                from a Canadian employer, of a specified minimum duration, and supported in the way
                the regulations require. In practice that usually means a labour market impact
                assessment behind it, or an equivalent employer-specific work permit position.
              </p>
              <p>
                An offer has to be real. An email saying “we’ll hire you” is not an offer for these
                purposes, and paying an agent for a letter is how people end up with a
                misrepresentation finding on their file — a far worse outcome than a refusal.
              </p>
              <p>
                You also still have to meet the trade’s ordinary employment requirements in Canada,
                apart from holding the certificate itself.

          <p>
            The trades programme sets a lower language standard than the Federal Skilled Worker
            Program, which is the single reason most tradespeople look at it. But it is not one
            number. The minister sets a threshold for each of the four abilities, and speaking and
            listening are held to a higher standard than reading and writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            The logic is obvious once you see it: on a Canadian work site you have to understand a
            spoken safety instruction, not read an essay. The practical consequence is that
            applicants who have prepared for an academic-style test — strong on reading, weak on
            speaking — can fail this programme while comfortably clearing others.
          </p>

            The current thresholds are published by IRCC and change from time to time. We confirm

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Express Entry manages three federal programmes: skilled workers, Canadian experience,
            and skilled trades. The trades stream is the narrowest of the three in practice, and it
            is worth understanding why before you build a plan around it. IRCC publishes every round
            of invitations, including which programme or category each round targeted — you can{' '}
            <a

              rel="noopener noreferrer"
              className="font-semibold text-accent-500 link-underline"

              read the official record of rounds of invitations
            </a>{' '}
            and judge the pattern for yourself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The bottleneck is not the language test and it is not the experience requirement. It is
            the certificate-or-offer condition. Provincial certification is designed around people
            who are already in Canada and can be assessed, examined or supervised there. A
            qualifying job offer requires a Canadian employer willing to go through a formal hiring
            process for someone abroad. Most tradespeople in Pakistan can produce neither, so they
            never enter the pool under this programme at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a second reason. Even candidates who qualify are ranked alongside everyone else
            in the pool, and rounds of invitations aimed specifically at the trades stream are
            occasional rather than routine. Alongside them IRCC also runs category-based rounds
            targeting trade occupations, and the provinces run their own nomination streams for
            tradespeople — in our experience those are the routes that more often carry a trades
            candidate through. Which rounds have actually been held, and under what selection, is a
            matter of public record on the IRCC page linked above.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of that makes it a bad route. It makes it a narrow one. If you are already working
            in Canada on a permit in your trade, or you have a real employer relationship, it can be
            the cleanest path available to you. If you are sitting in Lahore with fifteen years on
            the tools and no Canadian connection, it usually is not the right first move — and we
            will say so.
