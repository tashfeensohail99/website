          <p>
            Express Entry is not a programme. It’s the system Canada uses to manage several
            permanent residence programmes, and the Federal Skilled Worker Program is the one that
            accepts skilled work experience earned outside Canada — you do not need Canadian
            experience to use it. For many people applying from Pakistan, this is the relevant door.
          </p>
          <p>
            It suits a professional with real, documented, paid experience in a skilled occupation,
            a credential that stands up to assessment, and genuine ability in English or French.
            It does not require a job offer, and it does not require a Canadian employer to sponsor
            you. It does require you to be honestly competitive against a global pool of people
            trying to do the same thing.

              conversation is that your ranking may never become competitive on this route alone. In
              that case a provincial route, a study pathway, or a work-permit route may fit better —
              or nothing may fit right now. We will tell you that on the call rather than take a fee
              to file something we expect to fail. A refusal follows you.
