  {
    q: 'Can I use my Express Entry profile to immigrate to Quebec?',
    a: 'No. Express Entry manages the federal economic programmes, and some provinces outside Quebec run nomination streams that connect to it. Quebec sits outside that system entirely: it selects under its own accord with Canada, through its own portal, with its own criteria. A high federal score does nothing for a Quebec application, and Quebec selection does not produce a federal Express Entry invitation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is there a Quebec provincial nominee programme?',
    a: 'No. The provincial nominee framework applies to the other provinces and territories, which nominate candidates for the federal government to select. Quebec does not nominate — it selects, which is a stronger and structurally different power. If you see a "Quebec PNP" described anywhere, treat it as a sign the source has not checked how Quebec actually works.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I immigrate to Quebec without French?',
    a: 'For most Quebec economic routes, realistically no. French is not a bonus factor there in the way English or French is in the federal system — it is generally a condition of selection, at levels Quebec sets and publishes. There are limited situations where French is less central, but building a plan around finding one is usually a way of avoiding the real answer.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which French test do I need, and what level?',
    a: 'Quebec accepts specific French tests and diplomas and measures results against its own Échelle québécoise scale, with different requirements depending on the route and the skill level of your occupation. The list of accepted tests and the required levels are published by Quebec’s immigration ministry and are revised from time to time. Read them at the source rather than from a summary.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I get selected by Quebec and then settle in Ontario or Alberta?',
    a: 'Once you are a permanent resident, mobility rights are real — but that is not the point. Quebec selects on the basis that you intend to settle there, and you sign statements to that effect. Declaring an intention you do not hold risks a misrepresentation finding, with consequences that reach into the federal stage. That is territory for a licensed representative, not a website. Choose Quebec because you want Quebec.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I need a Quebec certificate to study or work there temporarily?',
    a: 'Temporary routes are handled differently from permanent selection. Quebec issues its own acceptance certificate — the CAQ — for many study and some temporary work situations, which sits alongside the federal permit rather than replacing it. Check whether your specific situation needs one before you apply federally, because the order matters.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can Quebec close a route or stop accepting applications?',
    a: 'Yes. Quebec sets its own intake and can pause, cap or restructure categories, including in family sponsorship, on its own timetable and without reference to federal planning. This is one reason we do not publish the current state of Quebec’s categories on this page. Confirm what is open on the day you apply.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee a Quebec selection certificate?',
    a: 'No, and nobody honestly can. Two separate governments make two separate decisions, and neither is ours. What we can do is tell you before you spend money whether Quebec is a realistic route for you — which, for applicants without French, it usually is not.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            Immigration in Canada is a shared responsibility, and every province has some role in
            selecting economic immigrants. Quebec’s role is different in kind. Under a long-standing
            accord between Quebec and the federal government, Quebec sets its own selection criteria
            for economic immigrants who intend to settle there, and applies them itself through its
            own immigration ministry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every other province nominates: it recommends a candidate, and the federal government
            selects. Quebec selects. Ottawa’s remaining role for a Quebec-selected applicant is
            admissibility — medical, criminality, security, identity, and whether the file is what it
            claims to be. That is a real decision and files do fail there, but it is a different
            question from whether your profile is wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            The practical consequence is the one people most often miss. Because selection is
            Quebec’s, the federal economic machinery does not operate there. There is no Quebec
            stream inside{' '}

              This is the most expensive misunderstanding on this route. Being selected by Quebec
              means Quebec wants you. It does not admit you to Canada. You still make a full federal
              permanent residence application, and it can be refused on admissibility grounds —
              medical inadmissibility, a criminal record, security concerns, or a finding of
              misrepresentation anywhere in the file.
            </p>
            <p>
              Plan and budget for both stages from the beginning, including the documents the federal
              stage will demand from you and your dependants, rather than treating the certificate as

            <Prose>
              <p>
                Quebec’s immigration policy is built around the continuity of French as the common
                language of public life. That is not a preference expressed through bonus points. In
                Quebec’s economic selection, demonstrated French ability generally functions as a
                condition of being selected at all, at levels Quebec defines on its own scale and
                varies by route and by the skill level of your occupation.
              </p>
              <p>
                English does not substitute for it. A strong English test result, a Canadian-recognised
                degree, or years of relevant experience will not compensate for the absence of French
                in the way a strong English score can carry a federal application.
              </p>
              <p>
                So the honest order of operations is: establish your French position first. Sit a
                test Quebec recognises. If you are starting from nothing, understand that reaching the
                levels Quebec expects is a substantial undertaking rather than a quick one — and decide
                with that in front of you. The accepted tests and the required levels are set and

              We will say this plainly because most people are not told it. If you do not have
              demonstrable French ability and are not willing to commit to reaching the level Quebec
              requires, the Quebec economic routes are impractical for you. Not difficult — impractical.
              There is no document, no agent and no fee that substitutes for the language.

              Quebec also does not suit applicants who want Canada generally rather than Quebec
              specifically, applicants who intend to join family or a community outside Quebec, or
              anyone attracted to it only because their federal profile is not competitive. In that
              last case the productive conversation is usually about improving the federal profile, or
              about a{' '}

              If French is genuinely part of your life or you are prepared to make it so, Quebec may be
              worth examining — and knowing which of those two paragraphs you are in is
              the point of the first conversation. Nothing on this page is a prediction of your
              outcome. Two governments decide this file and neither is

            Quebec sets its own language levels, criteria, intake and category structure, and revises
            them on its own timetable. We deliberately publish no thresholds, scores, fees or
            processing times here, because a figure that is correct today becomes a liability on a page
            you may read next year.
