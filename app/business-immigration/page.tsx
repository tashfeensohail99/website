 * Business and investment immigration.

 * Self-Employed Persons Program are not open to new applicants — because a great
 * deal of marketing is still selling both. Second, correct the belief that money
 * buys Canadian residence. It does not. What is left is provincial entrepreneur
 * streams, which require you to move and actually operate a business, and
 * business-owner work permits, which are temporary and are not permanent
 * residence.
 *
 * No figures, dates, thresholds or programme parameters on this page. Status and
 * numbers change; every one of them is linked to IRCC or the province instead.

Files already in the system are still being processed, and time-limited transitional arrangements have applied to people who already held a commitment certificate — the dates and conditions for those are on the IRCC page and you should read them there. IRCC has signalled a replacement pilot, but until something is actually published there is nothing to apply to. Anyone offering to file a new Start-Up Visa application for you now, or to sell you a designated-organisation introduction for one, is selling something that does not exist.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What about the Self-Employed Persons Program?',
    a: 'It is not taking new applications and remains paused. It was in any case a narrow route for people with significant experience in cultural activities or athletics who intend to be self-employed in that field in Canada — never a general route for business owners, despite how it is often marketed. Read the current status on the IRCC page rather than from an agent.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much do I need to invest to get Canadian permanent residence?',
    a: 'That question has no answer because the premise is wrong. Canada does not run a programme where a sum of money buys residence. Provincial entrepreneur streams do set minimum investment and net-worth levels, but meeting them entitles you to nothing on its own — you still have to move, operate the business, employ people, and meet the terms you signed before a nomination is considered. Anyone quoting you a price for Canadian residence is describing a product Canada does not sell.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I invest passively and let someone else run the business?',
    a: 'Not on these routes. Provincial entrepreneur streams are built around active, ongoing, day-to-day management by you, and the work-permit routes for business owners rest on the same principle. Silent partnerships, nominee arrangements and buy-a-share schemes are precisely what the streams are designed to exclude, and presenting one as active management is misrepresentation.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is an “owner-operator” work permit a route to permanent residence?',
    a: 'First, a correction: “owner-operator” is not the name of a programme. There is no dedicated owner-operator stream — a business owner applies through the ordinary work-permit framework, with a labour market assessment or under an exemption, and IRCC publishes which categories exist and what each requires. Second, whichever route applies, it is a temporary work permit, not residence, and it does not convert on its own. What it can do is put you in Canada lawfully, running a real business, generating Canadian management experience and a trading record — which may support a later provincial or federal application on its own merits. Treat it as a first step that might lead somewhere, not as residence in instalments.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Which province is easiest for entrepreneurs?',
    a: 'We will not answer that, because the criteria change and because choosing a province you do not intend to live in is a bad plan that also reads badly. The better question is where your sector, your capital and your family situation actually fit. Each province publishes its own current requirements and those are the figures to rely on.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How much are the fees and the minimum investment?',
    a: 'We deliberately do not print those numbers. Investment minimums, net-worth thresholds, deposit requirements and government fees are set by each province and by IRCC, and they are revised. A figure that is correct today becomes a liability on a page you read a year from now. Read them at the source on the day you need them.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can you guarantee a nomination or a permit?',
    a: 'No, and no one honestly can. Provincial nomination and federal permit decisions are made by governments, not by us. We publish a no-guarantee policy for that reason. What we can do is tell you before you spend money whether your capital, your experience and your willingness to relocate make this realistic.',

        <Prose>
          <p>
            IRCC has closed the Start-Up Visa to new applications. Files already in the system
            continue to be processed, and time-limited transitional arrangements have applied to
            people who held a commitment certificate before the closure — the cut-off dates for those
            arrangements are published by IRCC and you should read them there rather than here. For a
            new applicant, there is no application to submit.
          </p>
          <p>
            This matters because the Start-Up Visa was, for years, heavily marketed in Pakistan, and a
            good deal of that marketing has not stopped. If someone
            is currently offering to introduce you to a designated organisation, arrange a letter of
            support, or file a Start-Up Visa application on your behalf, they are describing a
            transaction that cannot happen. The correct response is to stop, not to ask the price.
          </p>
          <p>
            IRCC has signalled that a replacement entrepreneur pilot is intended. We will not
            speculate about what it might require, when it might open, or whether it will open at
            all. If and when it does, the terms will be on the IRCC site before they are on ours.

            <Prose>
              <p>
                Some countries operate schemes where a qualifying investment produces residence more
                or less directly. Canada, at the federal level, does not. There is no Canadian
                programme in which you transfer a sum of money, wait, and receive status.
              </p>
              <p>
                What exists instead are provincial entrepreneur streams, and they are conditional
                almost all the way through. You commit capital, you relocate, you establish or buy a
                business, you manage it yourself, you employ Canadians, you meet the terms of a signed
                agreement — and only then is a nomination considered. The investment is a requirement,
                not the mechanism.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is why the honest version of the conversation is often uncomfortable. Many people
                who arrive with capital and a good business record are not looking to emigrate and run
                a shop in a small Canadian city. If that is you, the business routes are probably not
                your routes, and it is better to hear that in the first hour than after the fees.

        <Prose>
          <p>
            If your aim is to be in Canada running a business now, rather than to obtain residence
            first, this is the route usually being described when someone says “owner-operator”. Be
            aware that “owner-operator” is not the name of a programme. There is no dedicated
            owner-operator immigration stream; there was once a distinct facilitated treatment for
            owner-operators within the labour market assessment process, and it was withdrawn. A
            business owner today applies through the ordinary work-permit framework — either with a
            labour market assessment, or under one of the exemptions, most commonly the one for work
            that brings a significant benefit to Canada. Which applies depends on the facts, and the
            categories and their conditions are published by IRCC.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two things about it are consistently misrepresented. First, it is a temporary permit. It
            is not permanent residence and it does not become permanent residence by the passage of
            time. What it can do is establish you in Canada with a real, trading, documented business
            — which may later support a provincial or federal application on its own merits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, the business has to be real. Officers assess whether the enterprise is genuine and
            viable, whether you actually control and run it, and what benefit it brings to Canada.
            Buying a dormant company to generate paperwork is a well-recognised pattern, it is
            expensive, and it risks a misrepresentation finding.
          </p>

            Assessment and which do not — are set out on{' '}

            <strong>Paying for a closed programme.</strong> The Start-Up Visa is still being sold. So,
            in places, is the Self-Employed Persons Program. Check the government page for the notice
            at the top before any money moves.

          <p>
            <strong>Source of funds that cannot be traced.</strong> The single most common reason
            business files fail. Property sold informally, business income kept outside the banking
            system, large family transfers with no paper behind them. The money may be entirely
            legitimate and still be undocumentable, and undocumentable is treated as unproven.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>A business plan bought off a shelf.</strong> Reviewers see the same templates
            repeatedly. A plan describing a market you have not researched, with costs that do not
            reconcile, signals that you do not intend to run the business.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>No intention to actually move.</strong> Streams are provincial and residence in
            that province is the point. Selecting a province purely because its criteria look lighter,
            while planning to live somewhere else, is visible in the file and undermines it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Treating the work permit as residence.</strong> People accept an owner-operator
            structure believing permanent residence follows automatically. It does not. Understand
            what you are buying before you commit capital to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Nominee and silent-partner structures.</strong> Arrangements where you hold a
            share on paper while someone else runs the business are the exact thing these streams
            exclude. Presenting one as genuine ownership is misrepresentation, which carries a bar on
            future applications — see{' '}

              Business immigration does not suit passive investors, people who want status while
              keeping their life and enterprise in Pakistan, or anyone whose plan depends on someone
              else operating the Canadian business. Every open route here is built on personal, active
              management in a specific province.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also tends not to suit people whose wealth is real but cannot be documented to a
              government standard, people whose management experience is family-business seniority
              without records behind it, and people who are unwilling to spend an initial period in
              Canada on a temporary permit before any nomination is considered.
