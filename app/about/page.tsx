        No — and neither can anyone else. Your visa is decided by a visa officer in another country.
        No consultant in Pakistan, including us, can overrule that officer. What we can do is tell
        you honestly whether your case is strong, fix what’s weak before it’s filed, and put it in
        front of that officer properly.

    q: 'Are you actually regulated? How do I check?',
    a: (
      <>
        Pakistan has no licensing body for immigration advice — anyone can rent an office and call
        themselves a consultant, which is exactly why so many people get hurt. A lawyer is different:
        there is a regulator you can complain to, and a public register you can check in about thirty
        seconds. Ask us for the licence number and verify it yourself before you pay a rupee.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'Do I have to visit an office in person?',
    a: (
      <>
        You don’t have to, but you’re welcome to — we have offices in three cities, not a mailbox and
        a WhatsApp number. If you’re in the Gulf and can’t reach Lahore yourself, someone you trust
        very likely can visit us in Mississauga. Consultations can also be held remotely.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: 'What does a consultation cost?',
    a: (
      <>
        Nothing. It used to be PKR 5,000, credited against your service fee — we dropped it because
        it put a price on the question itself. You leave with a written summary of where you stand,
        and you pay nothing unless you decide to go ahead.
      </>

  {
    q: 'What happens if you don’t think my case is strong?',
    a: (
      <>
        We tell you — before you owe us anything. We would rather lose the fee than file an
        application we don’t believe in and leave a refusal on your record. An honest “not yet” is
        worth more to you than a confident “yes”.

                Immigration is a decision people make once, with money they’ve saved for years. It
                attracts exactly the kind of operator you’re afraid of — a rented office, a brochure,
                a promise, and then silence. We can’t undo the stories you’ve heard. We can be the
                opposite of them, in ways you can confirm.
