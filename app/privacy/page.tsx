 *
 * What follows is an accurate description of what THIS WEBSITE does, which is
 * almost nothing: it is statically generated, sets no cookies, runs no analytics,
 * ships no client JavaScript and has no forms. That is unusual and worth stating
 * plainly — it is verifiable by anyone who opens dev tools, and this audience has
 * good reason to be suspicious.
 *
 * What it does NOT cover, and a lawyer must supply:
 *   • how the firm handles client data once someone becomes a client (passports,
 *     CNICs, bank statements — the CRM holds all of it)
 *   • retention periods
 *   • the lawful basis / consent posture under Pakistani law (PECA and the draft
 *     data-protection regime), plus GDPR/UK-GDPR exposure via the firm's ~114 UK
 *     contacts and its Canadian office (PIPEDA)
 *   • the named contact for data requests
 *
 * Do not let a designer or a copywriter fill those in. A privacy notice that
 * describes handling the firm does not actually do is worse than none: it is a
 * written, dated misstatement about exactly the data this audience most fears
 * losing.

          Sourced, not assumed. Meta's WhatsApp Business Platform Cloud API terms (last
          updated 2 Apr 2026) state: "You are the Controller of Company Personal Data and
          Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is the Processor" — and define Company Personal
          Data to include phone numbers, message CONTENT, personal identifiers and message
          metadata. So the firm carries controller responsibility for everything a client
          sends over WhatsApp. Meta is not the backstop here; the firm is.

          FOR COUNSEL: the Ireland-vs-Inc. split turns on where the contracting entity is
          "located" (US/Canada/Brazil ⇒ Meta Platforms, Inc.). The Mississauga office may
          change which Meta entity is processor. Also confirm whether any staff use the

        {/*
          The honest version of the law, from research dated 2026-07-17:

          Pakistan has NO data protection statute in force. Drafts exist (2018, 2021, the
          May 2023 MoITT draft that reached the Senate); none passed. PECA 2016 is criminal
          law — s.16 punishes misuse of identity information, but it imposes no consent,
          security, retention, breach-notice or access duties on a business. So a Pakistani
          firm holding passports is, as a matter of statute, largely unregulated.

          That is a fact worth stating plainly rather than hiding, because the honest
          conclusion favours the firm: the binding standard here is CANADIAN. PIPEDA
          applies to commercial activity in Ontario (no substantially-similar provincial
          law covers it), and the Mississauga office is commercial activity.

          FOR COUNSEL — the UK GDPR question, researched to primary sources:

          Art. 3(2)(a) catches a non-UK firm whose processing relates to "the offering of
          goods or services... to data subjects in the United Kingdom" (read directly at
          legislation.gov.uk/eur/2016/679/article/3). The test is INTENT TO TARGET, not
          client nationality. On the documented factors — ICO's own internal territorial-
          scope note (FOI IC-327905-Y2Y5, released 5 Sep 2024) and EDPB Guidelines 3/2018 —
          the indicia of targeting are GBP pricing, .co.uk domains, UK-paid search, UK
          marketing, UK phone numbers, UK testimonials. This site has NONE of them, and
          English alone is explicitly weak (it is a business language of Pakistan, so it
          signals nothing about the UK). "Mere accessibility" of a website is expressly
          NOT enough.

          So the marketing indicia point AWAY from scope. What points toward it is that the
          firm knowingly and repeatedly serves real UK-resident clients — and no example in
          either guidance squarely addresses that middle case. GENUINE JUDGMENT CALL.

          Note the site's zero-tracking design also closes the Art. 3(2)(b) monitoring
          route: no analytics, no pixels, nothing observing UK visitors' behaviour. That
          hook cannot be triggered by a page that does not watch anybody.

          If in scope, Art. 27 requires a UK representative in writing. Its exemption is
          CONJUNCTIVE — occasional AND not large-scale Art. 9/Art. 10 data AND unlikely to
          result in a risk. Correction worth having: passports, CNICs, bank statements and
          education records are NOT Art. 9 special-category data (Art. 9(1) covers race,
          politics, religion, trade union, genetic, biometric-ID, health, sex life). So that
          limb does not disqualify us automatically. But "occasional" means outside the
          regular course of business — which ongoing casework plainly is not — so the
          exemption still looks hard to reach. Lawyer's call, not ours.

          Still genuinely open:
            • Confirm the PDP Bill has not passed between Mar and Jul 2026 (secondaries
              only; nobody read the Gazette).
            • Do our files hold Art. 9 data in substance — health, religion, sexual
              orientation surfacing in spousal/asylum matters — or Art. 10 criminal-
              conviction data via character/admissibility disclosures? Not the documents
              themselves, but what is inside them.
            • BE&OE / Protector of Emigrants duties: applies to licensed Overseas
              Employment Promoters (labour recruiters). If we are a pure visa/immigration
              advisory we are likely outside it entirely — but that turns on our actual
              service mix.
        */}
        <h2 className="mt-12 font-serif text-3xl text-balance">The law that applies to your documents</h2>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          Here is something most Pakistani firms will not tell you:{' '}
          <strong className="text-ink-900">
            Pakistan has no data protection law in force.
          </strong>{' '}
          A bill has been drafted, redrafted and shelved since 2018. The cybercrime act that does
          exist punishes people who steal your data — it says almost nothing about what a business
          holding your passport must do to look after it.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          So when a firm in this market tells you your documents are “fully protected under the law”,
          ask them which law. There generally isn’t one.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          We think the absence of a rule is not a reason to have no standard. Because we operate an
          office in Canada, Canadian federal privacy law reaches part of what we do — and rather than
          run two standards, we would rather hold the whole firm to the higher one.
        </p>
        {/* NOTE FOR THE FIRM (does not render): confirm with counsel whether the
            "higher standard" line above reads as a binding undertaking or a policy,
            and the exact PIPEDA / UK-GDPR scope, before you rely on it. */}

        {/*
          Researched to primary sources 2026-07-17. The AML question is ANSWERED, not open:

          AMLA 2010 s.2(xxxiv) defines "reporting entity" as financial institutions +
          DNFBPs + anyone notified in the Gazette. The DNFBP list at s.2(xii) is closed,
          and the Federal Government's notification implementing the catch-all —
          S.R.O. (I)/2019, Finance Division, dated 23 Dec 2019, read directly at
          https://www.fmu.gov.pk/docs/DNFBP_Notification_Dec_23_2019_2.pdf — designates
          exactly four sectors: accountants, dealers in precious metals/stones, real estate
          agents, and lawyers. Immigration consultants are not there. So AMLA's retention
          duties (s.7(4): 10 years for STR/CTR records; s.7C: 5 years for CDD and
          transaction records) do NOT bind this firm.

          Conclusion: no Pakistani law mandates a retention period for these files.
          Retention is therefore a CHOICE, and the only real constraint is PIPEDA
          Principle 4.5 — keep only as long as necessary for the stated purpose.

          FOR COUNSEL, three live caveats:
            • The Gazette catch-all is open-ended. The Federal Government can notify this
              sector as a DNFBP at any time by a new SRO. This is a snapshot, not a
              guarantee. Re-check https://www.fmu.gov.pk/circulars-notifications/
            • The firm handles client money (fees, government charges). Charging your own
              fee is not the DNFBP "managing client money" limb — but the boundary is a
              lawyer's call, not ours.
            • Emigration Ordinance 1979 ss.17/18/19/22 ARE listed as AMLA Schedule-I
              PREDICATE offences. That is criminal exposure for individuals who commit
              emigration fraud — a different thing entirely from a reporting duty — but it
              is worth the firm understanding the distinction.

          Also verified and discarded: the "Punjab Travel Professionals Regulation Act 2012"
          that surfaces in searches is INDIAN Punjab legislation, not Pakistani. It does not
          apply. Do not let it back in.

        <p className="mt-4 text-ink-600 text-pretty">
          No Pakistani law tells us. There is no statute setting a retention period for immigration
