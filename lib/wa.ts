 * Build a click-to-WhatsApp link that the CRM can attribute.
 *
 * Why a token in the message body and not a query param: the WhatsApp webhook
 * only ever sees the sender's number and the message TEXT. Nothing else survives
 * the hop from browser to Meta to our webhook. So the only way to tell the CRM
 * "this person came from the C11 page" is to put a marker in the text the
 * customer sends.
 *
 * The webhook parses [Ref: XX-YYYY] on the FIRST inbound of a thread, resolves
 * it, and stamps sourceChannel='website' + serviceInterest + targetCountry on
 * the lead before handing off to the existing round-robin (ensureAssigned).
 * Without this every website enquiry is indistinguishable from the 22,582 cold
 * WhatsApp contacts that convert at ~0%, and the site looks like it does nothing.
 *
 * A plain <a href> — no widget, no script. It is 0 bytes, it survives ad
 * blockers, and it works on the mid-range Androids most of our audience uses.
