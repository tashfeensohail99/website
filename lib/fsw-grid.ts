/**
 * The Federal Skilled Worker 100-point selection grid (67-point pass mark).
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THIS IS NOT THE CRS SCORE. It is the pass/fail ELIGIBILITY test for the FSW
 * class, set in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations ss.75-83.
 * The CRS score out of 1,200 is a separate ranking applied afterwards, inside
 * the Express Entry pool. Confusing the two is the single most common
 * misunderstanding in this area, which is why they are separate modules.
 *
 * PROVENANCE. Derived twice independently and reconciled against IRPR
 * (SOR/2002-227), consolidation current to 26 May 2026, read directly on
 * laws-lois.justice.gc.ca — which, unlike canada.ca, does not block automated
 * access. Every value below is traceable to a numbered section.
 *
 * ARITHMETIC CHECK, which closes exactly:
 *   language 28 + education 25 + experience 15 + age 12
 *   + arranged employment 10 + adaptability 10 = 100
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * FOUR TRAPS. Each was caught by reconciliation, not by either derivation alone.
 *
 * 1. "WORK PERMIT" IS NOT THE WHOLE TEST. s.83(1)(c) reads "under a work permit
 *    OR AUTHORIZED UNDER SECTION 186". BOTH independent derivations wrote "work
 *    permit only". A tool that asks only "did you hold a work permit?" awards
 *    zero to genuinely qualifying applicants. The same phrase appears in
 *    s.83(1)(c.1) for the spouse, and s.83(2) has the equivalent "or under
 *    section 188" for study.
 *
 * 2. COUSINS DO NOT QUALIFY. s.83(5)(vi) is "child of the father or mother of
 *    their father or mother, other than their father or mother" — an aunt or
 *    uncle. An automated summary glossed this as "cousins". It is not.
 *
 * 3. ARRANGED EMPLOYMENT IS STILL WORTH 10 HERE. March 2025 removed the CRS
 *    bonus for a job offer. It did NOT touch s.82(2), which is part of this
 *    grid and confirmed in the current consolidation. A qualifying offer is
 *    worth 10 here plus 5 under adaptability s.83(1)(e) — 15 in total, subject
 *    to the adaptability cap.
 *
 * 4. ADAPTABILITY MUST BE CAPPED, NOT NORMALISED. The seven elements sum to 40
 *    against a hard maximum of 10. Sum them, then truncate.
